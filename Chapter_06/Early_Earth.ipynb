    "## Evolution of Metabolism and Early Microbial Communities\n",
    "The process of metabolism is a hallmark of all living organisms.  *[Catabolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism) reactions generate energy for the organism while [anabolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism) reactions are used for the synthesis of cell material.*  Metabolic pathways in today's living organisms have been evolving for more than $3.5\\ {\\rm Gyr}$.  The evolution of metabolism cannot be separated from the origin life because it was necessary for even the earliest organisms.  Contemporary metabolic pathways are presumed to be much more elaborate and sophisticated that those first evolved.  Metabolism today ranges from\n",
    "\n",
    "- the use of various inorganic chemicals (e.g., hydrogen or sulfur for energy), \n",
    "- several forms of photosynthesis, and\n",
    "- metabolism of hundreds of organic compounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is presently impossible for us to know which pathways originated first and how they evolved.  Understanding how metabolism evolved on the early Earth is of considerable importance.  Microorganisms resembling today's Bacteria and Archaea were most likely the first organisms, and the evolution of their metabolism is the most relevant.  Identifying the early evolution of metabolism in these organisms enables us to distinguish specific metabolic types from the later innovations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Setting: Conditions on Early Earth\n",
    "On the early Earth, there were *physical* and *chemical* conditions that influenced the evolution of metabolic processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One factor that influenced physical conditions was instability in the environment (e.g., large changes in available sunlight, water, or temperature).An impact of an asteroid ($R{\\sim}50\\ {\\rm km}$; see Fig. {numref}`{number}<impact-frustration-fig>`) can sterilize all surface life on our planet and evaporate a global ocean that is $3\\ {\\rm km}$ deep.  Only microbial ife at a depth of several ${\\rm km}$ could then survive.  Cosmic events affected early life in major and largely unknown ways that may have lead to the extinction of many species and redirection of the evolution of Earth's biota.  It is possible that catastrophic events during the early history of Earth may have also affected the evolution of metabolism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemical conditions on early Earth were marked by a relative dearth (absence) of nutrients that make life so rich today.  A steady supply of certain nutrients was available, which may have influenced the emergence of specific metabolic pathways.  Organic and other volatile materials are synthesized in space and became incorporated into the Earth through impacts by large bodies.  These impacts may have disrupted evolution, but also provided nutrients for life.  In addition, the abiotic synthesis of organic molecules occurred on Earth.  Acetic acid ($\\rm CH_3COOH$) synthesis has been shown to occur under primordial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although on the early Earth organic materials were less abundant than today, we may reasonably assume that they were present in sufficient quantities and varieties for life to originate and evolve.  Organic materials alone would not likely have been sufficient to sustain life.  Other nutrients were necessary for organisms to utilize electron donors and acceptors to generate metabolic energy needed for life (see Table {numref}`{number}<Nutrient_table>`).  The first metabolisms that arose were carried out *anaerobically* due to the lack of free oxygen.\n",

    "### Evidence for the Nature of Early Metabolisms\n",
    "A few categories of more direct evidence can elucidate the nature and timing of early metabolisms.  This evidence comes from three primary sources: **biomarkers**, **the geochemical record**, and **phylogenetic evidence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unique biomarkers have been useful for understanding early metabolisms.  Fro example, [hopanoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopanoids) are found only in cell membranes of the bacterial group *cyanobacteria*, which carryout oxygen-producing photosynthesis.  The presence of hopanoids has been used to date the evolution of these organisms to about ${2.5\\ {\\rm Ga}$.  This date agrees well with the geochemical record for oxygen production on Earth and supports the view that the first oxygenic photosynthetic organisms were cyanobacteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geochemical record has been useful in establishing evidence for certain types of metabolic activity.  Strong evidence indicates that carbon dioxide fixation was an early metabolic event on Earth, which is called *primary production*.  This is when environmental ${\\rm CO_2}$ is taken up and the carbon is incorporated into organic matter.  Carbon dioxide fixing organisms cause isotopic fractionation.  As a result in the Isua deposits in Greenland (that date to $3.5\\ {\\rm Ga}$), deposited organic carbon has a lighter isotopic signature than carbonate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Although this is excellent evidence that primary production occurred on early Earth, there is no definitive evidence about the nature of the earliest primary producing organisms.  Were they using chemical energy (chemosynthetic) or light energy (photosynthetic), and which organisms were responsible for this process.  the anaerobic methane oxidizing microbes are known to produce the lightest organic carbon, which may explain the existence of lighter organic carbon isotopes in certain layers of the Isua sediments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phylogenetic analysis is another useful approach for identifying which bacterial groups were involved in early metabolism.  By knowing which group of organisms evolved first, it is possible to hypothesize which metabolic activities arose first.  The deepest branches of the RNA Tree of Life are of thermophilic Archaea and Bacteria, implying that these are the earliest ancestors of any organisms still alive today.  However, two issues are important:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. discernible detail regarding the major groups of microorganisms is in adequate, so there remains a question about which organisms might have been the earliest; and\n",
    "2. horizontal gene transfer, which involves the exchange of genes among different lineages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most genes are transferred by vertical inheritance from one generation to another within a species.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the genes responsible for carrying out methanogenesis (methane production) have also been found in bacteria that are methane consumers.  Methanogens are found in the domain Archaea, whereas methane consumers are found in the domain Bacteria.  This sort of horizontal gene transfer makes it very difficult to trace the evolution of metabolic functions and other characteristics of organisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contemporary Metabolisms\n",
    "The evolution of life has changed the Earth, even as the Earth has provided the habitats for life.  For example the volution of oxygenic photosynthesis gave rise to oxygen on Earth and enabled the later evolution of aerobic metabolism.  To understand the evolution of metabolism, we study the essential metabolic features of present-day organisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anabolism\n",
    "One of the two major parts of metabolism is *anabolism* (i.e., constructive metabolism or biosynthesis), which is responsible for the building of new cell material for growth and reproduction.  The [heterotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotroph) synthesize cell material from organic molecules that are present in their environment.  In contrast, the [autotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotroph) make organic molecules from carbon dioxide in a process called carbon dioxide fixation.  The autotrophs are important because they are the *primary producers* that ultimately provide the entire biosphere with organic material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most advanced pathway for carbon dioxide fixation is the [Calvin-Benson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_cycle) used by plants and some bacteria as part of photosynthesis.  Other pathways include the acetyl coenzyme A, reverse tricarboxylic acid, and hydroxypropionate pathways. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Catabolism\n",
    "The chemical reactions that constitute metabolism must be thermodynamically feasible.  Anabolic reactions require energy to create order, and thus organism must also have *catabolic* pathways (i.e., destructive metabolism) to generate energy needed for anabolism.  Catabolic pathways are remarkably diverse, where some organism \"burn\" organic food using oxygen (i.e., aerobic organotropy).  Before oxygen, organisms \"breathed\" substances such as carbon dioxide, sulfate, iron, and other substances.  The [lithotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithotroph) \"eat\" hydrogen, sulfur, ammonia, and other unlikely-seeming foods.  The [phototrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototroph) harvest the energy of light.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Oxidation, reduction, and electron flow\n",
    "Catabolism follows the principles of oxidation and reduction.  These principles are best illustrating using a form of catabolism called *respiration*.  For respirers, oxidation corresponds to \"eating\" as reduction is to \"breathing.\"  Between the two types of reactions, electrons flow and the work done using catabolic energy is analogous to the work done by electrons flowing between the terminals of a battery. The only requirement is that the reaction has the potential to release energy, which condition is realized if the substance oxidized has a more negative electrical potential than the substance reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To generate energy the organism oxidizes (or \"eats\") the *electron donor*, while it reduces (or \"breathes\") the *electron receptor*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Respirers range from methanogens and acetogens, which utilize carbon dioxide and produce methane and acetic acid as waste products to aerobes (which use oxygen and produce water).  The electron acceptor has also been a major constraint in the evolution of catabolism because electron acceptors (e.g., oxygen) became abundant relatively late.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Respiration, photosynthesis, and fermentation\n",
    "The three forms of catabolism are **respiration**, **photosynthesis**, and **fermenation**, which are distinguished largely by their patterns of electron flow.  Respiration is the most straightforward because separate substances in the environment (i.e., *substrate*) are used by organism as electron donor and acceptor.  In photosynthesis and fermentation, electrons still flow from a donor to an acceptor, but the pattern is less intuitive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Photosynthesizers* take advantage of the key property of chlorophyll, which functions well as an electron acceptor and an effective electron donor (if energized by light).  As a result, electrons flow from and to chlorophyll in a cyclic pattern, doing work in the process.  Superimposed on this chlorophyll-driven cyclic electron flow, electrons from an electron-donating substrate are used to reduce carbon dioxide in carbon dioxide fixation.  *Fermenters* have a pattern, where an electron-donating substrate is oxidized and the electron acceptor is an internal metabolic intermediate rather than a substrate.  \n",
