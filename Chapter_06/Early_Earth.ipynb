    "## Evolution of Metabolism and Early Microbial Communities\n",
    "The process of metabolism is a hallmark of all living organisms.  *[Catabolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism) reactions generate energy for the organism while [anabolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism) reactions are used for the synthesis of cell material.*  Metabolic pathways in today's living organisms have been evolving for more than $3.5\\ {\\rm Gyr}$.  The evolution of metabolism cannot be separated from the origin life because it was necessary for even the earliest organisms.  Contemporary metabolic pathways are presumed to be much more elaborate and sophisticated that those first evolved.  Metabolism today ranges from\n",
    "\n",
    "- the use of various inorganic chemicals (e.g., hydrogen or sulfur for energy), \n",
    "- several forms of photosynthesis, and\n",
    "- metabolism of hundreds of organic compounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is presently impossible for us to know which pathways originated first and how they evolved.  Understanding how metabolism evolved on the early Earth is of considerable importance.  Microorganisms resembling today's Bacteria and Archaea were most likely the first organisms, and the evolution of their metabolism is the most relevant.  Identifying the early evolution of metabolism in these organisms enables us to distinguish specific metabolic types from the later innovations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Setting: Conditions on Early Earth\n",
    "On the early Earth, there were *physical* and *chemical* conditions that influenced the evolution of metabolic processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One factor that influenced physical conditions was instability in the environment (e.g., large changes in available sunlight, water, or temperature).An impact of an asteroid ($R{\\sim}50\\ {\\rm km}$; see Fig. {numref}`{number}<impact-frustration-fig>`) can sterilize all surface life on our planet and evaporate a global ocean that is $3\\ {\\rm km}$ deep.  Only microbial ife at a depth of several ${\\rm km}$ could then survive.  Cosmic events affected early life in major and largely unknown ways that may have lead to the extinction of many species and redirection of the evolution of Earth's biota.  It is possible that catastrophic events during the early history of Earth may have also affected the evolution of metabolism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemical conditions on early Earth were marked by a relative dearth (absence) of nutrients that make life so rich today.  A steady supply of certain nutrients was available, which may have influenced the emergence of specific metabolic pathways.  Organic and other volatile materials are synthesized in space and became incorporated into the Earth through impacts by large bodies.  These impacts may have disrupted evolution, but also provided nutrients for life.  In addition, the abiotic synthesis of organic molecules occurred on Earth.  Acetic acid ($\\rm CH_3COOH$) synthesis has been shown to occur under primordial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although on the early Earth organic materials were less abundant than today, we may reasonably assume that they were present in sufficient quantities and varieties for life to originate and evolve.  Organic materials alone would not likely have been sufficient to sustain life.  Other nutrients were necessary for organisms to utilize electron donors and acceptors to generate metabolic energy needed for life (see Table {numref}`{number}<Nutrient_table>`).  The first metabolisms that arose were carried out *anaerobically* due to the lack of free oxygen.\n",

    "### Evidence for the Nature of Early Metabolisms\n",
    "A few categories of more direct evidence can elucidate the nature and timing of early metabolisms.  This evidence comes from three primary sources: **biomarkers**, **the geochemical record**, and **phylogenetic evidence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unique biomarkers have been useful for understanding early metabolisms.  Fro example, [hopanoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopanoids) are found only in cell membranes of the bacterial group *cyanobacteria*, which carryout oxygen-producing photosynthesis.  The presence of hopanoids has been used to date the evolution of these organisms to about $2.5\\ {\\rm Ga}$.  This date agrees well with the geochemical record for oxygen production on Earth and supports the view that the first oxygenic photosynthetic organisms were cyanobacteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geochemical record has been useful in establishing evidence for certain types of metabolic activity.  Strong evidence indicates that carbon dioxide fixation was an early metabolic event on Earth, which is called *primary production*.  This is when environmental ${\\rm CO_2}$ is taken up and the carbon is incorporated into organic matter.  Carbon dioxide fixing organisms cause isotopic fractionation.  As a result in the Isua deposits in Greenland (that date to $3.5\\ {\\rm Ga}$), deposited organic carbon has a lighter isotopic signature than carbonate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Although this is excellent evidence that primary production occurred on early Earth, there is no definitive evidence about the nature of the earliest primary producing organisms.  Were they using chemical energy (chemosynthetic) or light energy (photosynthetic), and which organisms were responsible for this process?  The anaerobic methane oxidizing microbes are known to produce the lightest organic carbon, which may explain the existence of lighter organic carbon isotopes in certain layers of the Isua sediments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phylogenetic analysis is another useful approach for identifying which bacterial groups were involved in early metabolism.  By knowing which group of organisms evolved first, it is possible to hypothesize which metabolic activities arose first.  The deepest branches of the RNA Tree of Life are of thermophilic Archaea and Bacteria, implying that these are the earliest ancestors of any organisms still alive today.  However, two issues are important:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. discernible detail regarding the major groups of microorganisms is in adequate, so there remains a question about which organisms might have been the earliest; and\n",
    "2. horizontal gene transfer, which involves the exchange of genes among different lineages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most genes are transferred by vertical inheritance from one generation to another within a species.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the genes responsible for carrying out methanogenesis (methane production) have also been found in bacteria that are methane consumers.  Methanogens are found in the domain Archaea, whereas methane consumers are found in the domain Bacteria.  This sort of horizontal gene transfer makes it very difficult to trace the evolution of metabolic functions and other characteristics of organisms."

    "### Contemporary Metabolisms\n",
    "The evolution of life has changed the Earth, even as the Earth has provided the habitats for life.  For example the volution of oxygenic photosynthesis gave rise to oxygen on Earth and enabled the later evolution of aerobic metabolism.  To understand the evolution of metabolism, we study the essential metabolic features of present-day organisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anabolism\n",
    "One of the two major parts of metabolism is *anabolism* (i.e., constructive metabolism or biosynthesis), which is responsible for the building of new cell material for growth and reproduction.  The [heterotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotroph) synthesize cell material from organic molecules that are present in their environment.  In contrast, the [autotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotroph) make organic molecules from carbon dioxide in a process called carbon dioxide fixation.  The autotrophs are important because they are the *primary producers* that ultimately provide the entire biosphere with organic material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most advanced pathway for carbon dioxide fixation is the [Calvin-Benson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_cycle) cycle used by plants and some bacteria as part of photosynthesis.  Other pathways include the acetyl coenzyme A, reverse tricarboxylic acid, and hydroxypropionate pathways. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Catabolism\n",
    "The chemical reactions that constitute metabolism must be thermodynamically feasible.  Anabolic reactions require energy to create order, and thus organism must also have *catabolic* pathways (i.e., destructive metabolism) to generate energy needed for anabolism.  Catabolic pathways are remarkably diverse, where some organism \"burn\" organic food using oxygen (i.e., aerobic organotropy).  Before oxygen, organisms \"breathed\" substances such as carbon dioxide, sulfate, iron, and other substances.  The [lithotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithotroph) \"eat\" hydrogen, sulfur, ammonia, and other unlikely-seeming foods.  The [phototrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototroph) harvest the energy of light.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Oxidation, reduction, and electron flow\n",
    "Catabolism follows the principles of oxidation and reduction.  These principles are best illustrating using a form of catabolism called *respiration*.  For respirers, oxidation corresponds to \"eating\" as reduction is to \"breathing.\"  Between the two types of reactions, electrons flow and the work done using catabolic energy is analogous to the work done by electrons flowing between the terminals of a battery. The only requirement is that the reaction has the potential to release energy, which condition is realized if the substance oxidized has a more negative electrical potential than the substance reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To generate energy the organism oxidizes (or \"eats\") the *electron donor*, while it reduces (or \"breathes\") the *electron receptor*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Respirers range from methanogens and acetogens, which utilize carbon dioxide and produce methane and acetic acid as waste products, to aerobes (which use oxygen and produce water).  The electron acceptor has also been a major constraint in the evolution of catabolism because electron acceptors (e.g., oxygen) became abundant relatively late.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Respiration, photosynthesis, and fermentation\n",
    "The three forms of catabolism are **respiration**, **photosynthesis**, and **fermentation**, which are distinguished largely by their patterns of electron flow.  Respiration is the most straightforward because separate substances in the environment (i.e., *substrate*) are used by organism as electron donor and acceptor.  In photosynthesis and fermentation, electrons still flow from a donor to an acceptor, but the pattern is less intuitive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Photosynthesizers* take advantage of the key property of chlorophyll, which functions well as an electron acceptor and an effective electron donor (if energized by light).  As a result, electrons flow from and to chlorophyll in a cyclic pattern, doing work in the process.  Superimposed on this chlorophyll-driven cyclic electron flow, electrons from an electron-donating substrate are used to reduce carbon dioxide in carbon dioxide fixation.  *Fermenters* have a pattern, where an electron-donating substrate is oxidized and the electron acceptor is an internal metabolic intermediate rather than a substrate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ATP and the proton-motive force\n",
    "Catabolism consists of metabolic pathways that involve oxidation and reduction.  *How is the energy actually stored and transferred?*  Adenosine triphosphate ([ATP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate)) is the energy currency of biology, ATP contains [phosphoanhydride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-energy_phosphate) bonds that yield energy upon hydrolysis (i.e., breakdown through combination of water).  Certain other compounds have energy-rich bonds too, including adenosine diphosphate ([ADP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate)), pyrophospate ([PP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrophosphate)), and other metabolic intermediates.  ATP predominates in present-day organisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formation of ATP and the hydrolysis of ATP provide the energy link between catabolism and anabolism, where the former generates ATP and the latter uses ATP.  The mechanism of ATP generation is usually simplest in the case of *fermentation*, where ATP is directly generated by reactions that are part of a metabolic intermediate containing an energy-rich phosphoanhydride bond that transfers its phosphate to ADT and forming ATP.\n",
    "\n",
    "For *respiration* and *photosynthesis*, ATP is generated in a two-stage process in which the cell membrane plays an essential role.  Just as a membrane is necessary to separate the contents of a cell, so is a membrane necessary for energy generation and storage.  The principle is akin to charge separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The flow of electrons through a membrane-bound electron transport chain crates a potential between the interior and exterior of the cell.\n",
    "2. Protons move across the potential due to the electromotive force and gradient in pH (proton concentration).  This movement of protons is called the proton-motive force within biology.\n",
    "3. The energy supplied by the proton-motive force is then used to make ATP, via a membrane-bound enzyme called ATP synthase that couples the synthesis of ATP to the import of protons.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is termed *electron transport phosphorylation* or *oxidative phosphorylation*.  Hence the cell membrane plays a central role not only in the cell's structural integrity, but also in its ability to generate energy.\n",

    "#### Energy yields of catabolism\n",
    "All catabolic mechanisms lead to the generation of ATP.  *But which forms of catabolism generate the most ATP and are the most advantageous for the organism?*  A quantity used by chemists to evaluate the energy yield of a reaction is the change in [Gibbs free energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_free_energy) ($\\Delta G$) expressed in kilojoules ($\\rm kJ$).\n",
    "\n",
    "A large negative $\\Delta G$ indicates a high yield of energy, while a positive $\\Delta G$ signifies that energy is consumed.  Hence, all catabolic pathways must have a negative $\\Delta G$, where the more negative the better.  **The $\\Delta G$ depends on the relative electrical potential of the electron donors and acceptors.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Aerobic respiration (ATP yield $=38$) using glucose (${\\rm C_6H_{12}O_6}$) as an electron donor and oxygen as an electron acceptor is one of the most effective in producing ATP:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "{\\rm C_6H_{12}O_6} + 6{\\rm O_2} \\rightarrow 6{\\rm CO_2} + 6{\\rm H_2O}; \\qquad \\Delta G = -2870\\ {\\rm kJ}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Aerobic respiration produces a large negative $\\Delta G$ because the oxidation of glucose occurs at a very negative redox potential, while the reduction of oxygen occurs at a very positive redox potential.  Organisms that carry out aerobic respiration can grow fast, which includes highly evolved forms such as animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Photosynthesis is effective through the light-driven electron flow via chlorophyll and appreciated when one realizes that [oxygenic photosynthesis](https://openstax.org/books/biology-2e/pages/6-1-energy-and-metabolism) is the reverse of aerobic respiration.  Since the reverse of an energy-yielding process is an energy-requiring one, the use of light via chlorophyll must be very effective.  Like animals, plants are also highly evolved and successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other forms of respiration (e.g., methanogenesis or sulfate reduction) yield less energy:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "4{\\rm H_2} + {\\rm CO_2} &\\rightarrow {\\rm CH_4} + 2{\\rm H_2O}; \\qquad \\Delta G = -131\\ {\\rm kJ}, \\quad \\mathbf{(methanogenesis)} \\\\\n",
    "4{\\rm H_2} + {\\rm SO_4^{2-}} + {\\rm H^+} &\\rightarrow {\\rm HS^-} + 4{\\rm H_2O}; \\qquad \\Delta G = -152\\ {\\rm kJ}. \\quad \\mathbf{(sulfate\\ reduction)}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Although methanogens and sulfate reducers use electron donors with a large negative redox potential (e.g., hydrogen or organic substances), the electron acceptors (carbon dioxide and sulfate) have redox potentials that are also in the negative range.  Thus, the $\\Delta G$'s have small negative values and the ATP yields are low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fermenters are also limited by small redox potential differences between the electron donor and acceptor.  [Lactic acid fermentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid_fermentation) (ATP yield $=2$) has a low ATP yield and $\\Delta G = -196\\ {\\rm kJ}$.  Fermenters also lack the opportunity to fully oxidize their substrates."

    "### Early Metabolic Mechanisms\n",
    "Metabolism today is complex and diverse.  One of our tenets is that life, and metabolism, began simpler and more uniform.  The continuity of evolution means that all contemporary metabolism evolved from these modes beginnings.  Our other tenet is the early life had to make do with the nutrients that were available.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Oparin](https://saturnaxis.github.io/Astrobio/Chapter_05/Tree_of_Life.html#the-oparin-haldane-hypothesis) originally hypothesized that the first metabolisms were not photosynthetic, where organisms obtained organic carbon from their surroundings rather than synthesizing it photosynthetically from carbon dioxide (i.e., heterotrophic).  Photosynthetic organisms are much more complex than heterotrophic organisms because they need pathways to carryout out photosynthesis and corban dioxide fixation.  This is in addition to the anabolic pathways for synthesis of amino acids and other cell materials.  In contrast, heterotrophic metabolism requires relatively few enzymes to produce cell material from organic precursors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple type of catabolism is the [Stickland reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stickland_fermentation) that occurs in certain bacteria and involves the fermentation of amino acid pairs.  In this reaction, only two amino acids are needed and very few enzymes are required for catabolism and generation of ATP.  It is interesting to note that alanine and glycine in examples of the Stickland reaction are very stable and commonly found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites.  Therefore, these substrates may have been available for metabolism early on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis that heterotrophic metabolism arose first ignores the importance of primary production (i.e., the production of organic material either by chemosynthesis or photosynthesis).  Heterotrophic organisms *require* preformed organic material.  Although organic substrates may have been abundant on early Earth, within a short time they would have been depleted by any heterotrophic organisms.  Some process in which organic material is produced biologically on Earth is of fundamental importance in early metabolism.  The most important question concerning early metabolism becomes: *What were the most likely metabolism(s) of the initial primary producers?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolution of Methanogenesis and Acetogensis\n",
    "#### Today and on the early Earth\n",
    "Methanogens and acetogens partly share analogous metabolic pathways, although not phylogenetically related.  Methanogens and acetogens are both anaerobes that specialize in metabolism using one-carbon intermediates.  Hydrogen is a common electron donor and carbon dioxide a common electron acceptor.  Methane and acetic acid are the respective catabolic products.  Both organisms fix carbon dioxide by the acetyl coenzyme A ($\\mathbf{\\rm CoA}$) pathway.  Today methanogens and acetogens play essential roles in anaerobic ecosystems and live in a variety of habitats ranging from hydrothermal vents, pond sediments, and animal digestive tracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "A coenzyme is any non-protein molecule required for the functioning of an enzyme.  Coenzyme A is a specific sulfur-containing organic coenzyme.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, methanogens in sediments team up with a variety of fermenters to convert cellulose-type materials to methane and carbon dioxide.  Before photosynthesis, the Earth and its biosphere were quite different.  Organic materials were limited to those formed by abiotic processes and by a feeble primary production.  Autotrophy (or primary producers) may have been preferred over heterotrophy, necessitating a means of carbon dioxide fixation.  On the early Earth, electron donors and acceptors for catabolism may have been rare or limited to a few elements or compounds.  In this most ancient of biological worlds, methanogens or acetogen may have been the *only* metabolic types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogs of the early Earth may exist today:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Microbial communities in the Earth's subsurface are apparently dominated by methanogens that obtain hydrogen from reduced minerals in rock.\n",
    "- Deep basalt aquifers, hot springs, and submarine hydrothermal vents are examples of sites where microbial ecosystems may be supported by hydrogen of geological origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "These environments that are poor in organic material but potentially rich in mineral nutrients could resemble ecosystems that dominate on the early Earth or that may exist on other planetary bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Metabolic simplicity and the acetyl CoA pathway\n",
    "It is reasonable to assume that the earliest organisms were also the simplest.  Frequent bombardment of the early Earth might have limited the time available for complexity ot evolve.  From this standpoint, methanogenesis and acetogenesis are appealing as the earliest metabolisms.  In its simplest form, the metabolisms of methanogens and acetogens each consist of three essential pathways.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. reduction of carbon dioxide to a methyl ($\\rm CH_3$) group,\n",

Other pathways of carbon dioxide fixation are more complex, involving various numbers of multi-carbon intermediates.  Because of its simplicity the acetyl $\\rm CoA$ pathway may have been the easiest to evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A prebiotic precursor for acetyl COA pathway\n",
    "Further support for the ancient nature of the acetyl $\\rm CoA$ pathway comes from evidence that the crucial reaction could have occurred prebiotically.  [G&uuml;nther W&auml;chtersh&auml;user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCnter_W%C3%A4chtersh%C3%A4user) proposed the theory that metabolism evolved from prebiotic chemistry, where he has shown in the laboratory that under primordial conditions a methyl group can react with carbon monoxide to yield an acetyl group ([Huber and W&auml;chtersh&auml;user (1997)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.276.5310.245)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly interesting was the observation that the reaction required nickel sulfide and iron sulfide as catalysts.  The enzyme that catalyzes the reaction in present-day organisms also contains a nick-iron-sulfur center.  A core step in the metabolism of methanogens  and acetogens may have derived from a prebiotic chemical reaction.  W&auml;chtersh&auml;user has suggested that the combined presence of methyl mercaptan ($\\rm CH_3SH$), iron sulfide, and nickel sulfide could constitute important components of a \"marker\" for primitive habitats on Earth and Mars.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hydrogen oxidation and the proton-motive force\n",
    "Another significant feature of the methanogenic and acetogenic metabolism is the use of $\\rm H_2$ as the catabolic electron donor.  The electron transport chain of many organism is a complex multi-component assembly that moves proteins from inside to the outside of cells as electrons flow from one electron carrier to another.  These complex electron chains are characteristic of organotrophs and phototrophs, as well as aerobic lithotrophs that oxidize inorganic compounds other than hydrogen. \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of hydrogen offers the possibility of a simpler mechanism of a simpler mechanism in which a proton-motive force is generated without the transport of protons.  The products of hydrogen oxidation are simply protons and electrons.  If the oxidation of hydrogen occurs on the outside of the cell membrane, then protons can accumulate there.  A simple electron carrier that spans the membrane can then deliver electrons to the inside.  The electrons can then be used on the inside in a proton-consuming reaction to reduce carbon dioxide to methane or acetic acid.  The result is a proton-motive force.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple mechanism requiring only an extracellular hydrogen-oxidizing enzyme (hydrogenase) and a membrane-bound electron carrier (e.g., iron-sulfur protein) has not yet actually been demonstrated in the methanogens or acetogens.  But neither is it excluded as a primordial mechanism or as one that operates today.\n"

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the ${\\rm O_2}$ comes from the water and not the carbon dioxide.  For this reason, oxygenic photosynthesis is called the \"water splitting\" reaction.  Apart from cyanobacteria, all photosynthetic bacteria carry out photosynthesis anaerobically and oxygen is *not* produced.  This anaerobic process is referred to as *anoxygenic* photosynthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "*When did photosynthesis evolve?*  The availability  of suitable substrates is not a constraint because they were all available, as was light.  The main constraint has to do with complexity.  to generate a proton-motive force photosynthetically requires the addition of chlorophyll, aw well as a relatively complex electron transport chain  involving the transport of protons across the membrane.  This mechanism is more likely to have followed the relatively simple ${\\rm H_2}$ chemosynthetic mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time of emergence of different photosynthetic types is unresolved in the geologic record, but available evidence suggests that anoxic phototrophs predated the cyanobacteria.  At that time the entire planet was anoxic, since the cyanobacteria had yet to begin to oxygenate the atmosphere and oceans.  The evolutionary emergence of the cyanobacteria was the result of a remarkable biochemical innovation, where the development of a light-driven electron transport system that could fix $\\rm CO_2$ with electrons extracted from water, liberating its oxygen.  This photosystem, composed of two photosynthetic reaction centers, was likely built upon the machinery of earlier simpler microorganisms that were restricted to anoxic habitats and that used reduced sulfur as a source of electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time of cyanobacterial emergence has been dated to $2.1-2.5\\ {\\rm Ga}$ on the basis of protein sequences, which is consistent with the geochemical estimate for the era of oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere and oceans (i.e., from the banded iron formations).  The evolution of photosynthesis liberated microbial life from dependence on geochemically produced, reduced substrates (e.g., $\\rm H_2S$), resulting in an explosive increase in biomass on Earth.  By using water as a reductant, life was free to fully colonized the planet, now requiring only water, light, carbon dioxide, and organic substrates for growth and division.\n",
    "\n",
    "The innovation of oxygenic photosynthesis began a remarkable evolutionary progression, culminating in the development of complex animal and planet species.  The development of an oxygen-rich atmosphere prepared the biosphere for the emergence of higher life forms.  Only by burning reduced carbon with oxygen (via an electron transport chain) could sufficient energy be released to fuel large multicellular organisms.  The resultant atmospheric oxygen produced an ozone layer in the statosphere that is strongly absorbent of UV radiation.  When the ozone layer became significant, this opened up land to colonization by planets and animals (due to lower UV radiation) who no longer needed water for protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aerobic Metabolism\n",
    "Aerobic metabolism is the culmination of metabolic evolution on Earth.  This was made possible due to the superior energy yield from using oxygen as an electron acceptor.  The microbial world expanded along with multicellular organisms.  New kinds of chemolithotrophs: oxidizers of nitrogen, sulfur, and iron compounds evolved and have become an important part of today's nutrient cycles.  The innovations in the electron transport chain that came with photosynthesis allowed aerobes to take advantage of this new source of energy.  Indeed, many of the same components of the electron transport chain that evolved for photosynthesis are used in aerobic respiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Earth's Earliest Communities\n",
    "If you were to visit the Earth during any average point in its history, the scene would be other-worldly.  For most of Earth's history it was the planet of the microbes.  The land would be mostly barren of visible life.  Only in shallow freshwater and intertidal marine basins would there be visible accumulation of life, in the form of microbial mat communities.  [Microbial mats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbial_mat) are macroscopically visible microbial ecosystems in which microbes build communities that in may ways are analogous to rain forests.  They are layered communities that today develop as carpets, often many centimeters thick, in certain types of shallow aquatic settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure-md} microbial-mats-fig\n",
    "<img src=\"microbial_mat1.jpg\"  width=\"700px\">\n",

    "General structures of microbial mats. The thickness can range from millimeters to several centimeters, and are formed by multiple biofilms of microorganisms embedded in a matrix of exopolysaccharides, in a vertical fashion due to the physical gradients.

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The structural coherence of the community is provided by extracellular polymers produced by the mat microorganism and by the filamentous forms of some dominant populations.  The top layer (i.e., canopy), primarily consists of oxygen-producing bacteria, cyanobacteria.  Together with the anoxygenic phototrophs, the cyanobacteria sustain a remarkably diverse undergrowth of other microorganisms.  Virtually all major physiological types of microbes are resident in contemporary microbial mats, and they sustain all central biogeochemical cycles, where each element is alternately oxidized and reduced by the metabolism of different microorganisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the microscope, the activities of these highly organized populations shape the chemical structure of the mat, forming sharp gradients of oxygen, $\\rm pH$, sulfide, and other chemical species (via a metabolic process).  High productivity by photo- or chemosynthesis allows each mat to sustain significant biomass on little more than water, sunlight, and available inorganic nutrients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most impressive mat communities occur in extreme environments (compared to conditions for multicellular life), since significant biomass accumulation can only occur in the absence of grazing.  For example, today's mats of thermophilic cyanobacteria are common in hot springs worldwide.  Mats also thrive in hypersaline lagoons, as well as in intermittently dry intertidal regions. Mats also build calcified stromatolites in warm seas, from desert soil crust, and grow within the frozen rocks of Antarctica as endolithic mats.  They even thrive embedded in the ice cover of Antarctic dry valley lakes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fossil record suggests that mats were once widely distributed on early Earth.  The decline of extensive microbial mat systems in the rock record is generally attributed tot he emergence of multicellular grazers and water planets that ultimate forced them to a much more limited habitat range.  The most conspicuous and often enigmatic vestiges of the early microbial biosphere and microbial mats are stromatolites.  It is generally accepted (but not always proven) that the sediment trapping or mineral precipitation processes that formed stromatolites were mediated by ancient microbial communities.  The existence of fossil stromatolites beginning in the early and middle Archean is consistent with isotopic evidence fro autotrophic carbon fixation in the early Archean, and very strongly suggests that photoautotrophy existed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today there is increasing recognition that microorganisms are extremely promiscuous.  Horizontal gene transfer is not restricted to closely related organisms.  Exchange within and between domains is now well documented and increasingly recognized to be a major force in shaping metabolic innovation.  We speculate that the high density and close associations among microorganisms in microbial mat provided a superb environment for genetic exchange between populations.  If this is true, some of the most significant events in the history of our planet may have occurred in microbial mats.  For example, the cyanobacteria may have emerged within this context as a result of melding the photosystems of anoxic phototrophs. "

Exposure to this level of vacuum causes extreme dehydration of cells such that naked spores can survive for only days.  Survival of spores i increased if they are associated with various chemicals (e.g., sugars or embedded in salt crystals).  [Nicholson et al.

These *biofilms* are physically and physiologically complex.  The niche within a mature biofilm allows both physiological and genetic transformations of the encapsulated organisms.  The immediate environment of cells within a biofilm can affect the delivery of nutrients and the availability of energy sources, which leads to a range of activities.  Heterogeneity within biofilms has also been shown to play a role in resistance to environmental stress.\n",

    "Models for early life are based on geological, geochemical, and isotopic evidence of biosignatures in the earliest rocks, inferences from global phylogenetic trees, and the biochemical characteristics of extant organisms.  The deep-sea and the sub-seafloor are two of the modeled sites for the earliest microbial ecosystems.  These are safe havens from killer impact events, as well as sites of ubiquitous and active geophysical processes, including hydrothermal activity that can generate carbon and chemical energy sources, along with other elements required for life. (see [National Geographic: Exploring the Edge of Existence](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/deep-sea-hydrothermal-vents) about the discovery of the hydrothermal vents.)\n",

    "There are models that support the hypothesis that hydrothermal systems were involved in the origin of life and that microorganisms related to extant hydrothermal vent extremophiles were the earliest organisms.  The implication is that submarine hydrothermal systems can both generate and support life without the need for oxidants needed for photosynthesis.  While these remain hypotheses, there is convincing evidence that microorganisms capable of exploiting the chemical energy sources at vents (particularly $\\rm H_2$) preceded photosynthesizing microorganisms.  Biochemical evidence indicates that the first photosynthetic organisms were anaerobic and coupled the reduction of $\\rm CO_2$ with the oxidation of $\\rm H_2S$ rather than $\\rm H_2O$.\n",

    "To date (on Earth), we know of two primary types of hydrothermal processes that drive warm- to high-temperature flow in the sub-seafloor.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ridge-axis, hydrothermal circulation driven by upwelling magma or recently solidified hot rock often producing spectacular hydrothermal chimneys (or \"black smokers\").  Water-rock reactions commensurate with high-temperature-driven fluid flow result in fluid temperatures up to $407\\ \\rm ^\\circ C$ and produce distinct chemistries containing high concentrations of metals and low $\\rm pH$.\n",
    "2. The exothermic serpentinization of ultramafic rocks, which yields moderate temperature fluids ($<150\\ \\rm ^\\circ C$) in comparison to ridge-axis systems.  These fluids are highly alkaline (up to $\\rm pH$ 12), and contain elevated levels of volatile compounds (e.g., $\\rm CH_4$ and $\\rm H_2$) relative to ridge-axis systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third source of hydrothermal activity is tidal heating that occurs when differential gravitational forces from a planet \"flex\" one of its moons, usually in concert with gravitational effects from other moons.  Tidal heating is the best explanation for geysers on Enceladus and is also believed to be important in maintaining a liquid ocean on Europa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong hydrothermally driven fluid circulation is a fundamental physical-chemical process that was likely present on Earth as soon as it had appreciable amounts of liquid water.  Hydrothermal activity on the early Earth may have been even more pervasive than today due to higher global heat fluxes (due to much more closely orbiting Moon and geophysical activity).  A hallmark feature of hydrothermal systems is dynamic mixing between fluids of varying compositions.  These mixing processes occur at multiple spatial and temporal scales, including\n",

    "- the instantaneous process of sulfide mineral precipitation seen at black smokers, and\n",
    "- the modest thermal and chemical gradients in the sub-seafloor.\n",
    "\n",
    "A vast majority of the mixing occurs within the fractures and pore spaces of rocks, where the fluids interact with and alter the host materials.  Hydrothermal systems also experience periodic perturbations linked to the tides, and are intertwined with episodic processes such as earthquake activity, opening and sealing of fractures, and magma intrusion events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The surface-associated microbiology of present-day hydrothermal vent environments may also be relevant to the origin and early evolution of Earth-life.  Abiotic reactions facilitated by mineral surfaces catalyze a number of reactions that may have substituted for early metabolic process.  This idea has been expanded to where mineral catalysis could have preceded all enzyme catalysis during the inferred early, non-protein stage in the origin of life. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aggregated communities found on mineral surfaces may have been important to the early evolution of life in that their diversity could have facilitated a high rate of genetic exchange and over the evolutionary limitations of any single lineage.  Hydrothermal systems of the present-day Earth have not changed significantly from those present millions of years ago.  Such systems may arbor relict microorganisms and biochemistries that can aid in our understanding of the origin of Earth-life.\n",
