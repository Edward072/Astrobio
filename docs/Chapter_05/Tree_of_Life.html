<h3><span class="section-number">5.1.1. </span>Why is This Question Important?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-this-question-important" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Our current sample for life in the universe is limited to on or near the surface of our home planet.  Therefore, one of our first questions considers how life first took root here, and whether things that we would consider alive exist elsewhere.  The fossil record on Earth appears to extent to about 3.5 Gyr ago and isotopic evidence suggests the presence of life several hundred million years before that.  However, no hard evidence exists concerning the mechanism by which life first began on Earth.</p>
<p>Every human culture has developed an answer to this question and considered its importance in defining our place in the cosmos.  in the absence of firm evidence, the door has been left open to a variety of answers from science, mythology, and religion.  Each of these modes approaches our place in the Universe in a different way and with a different purpose.  These points of view can be broadly separated into three groups: Biblical-Creationist, Improbable Event, and Cosmic Evolution.</p>
<div class="section" id="group-i-biblical-creationist">
<h4><span class="section-number">5.1.1.1. </span>Group I: Biblical-Creationist<a class="headerlink" href="#group-i-biblical-creationist" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In the Biblical-Creationist view, life began directly through the actions of a Creator <em>using supernatural means</em>.  This view is accepted by a large fraction of our population, although it is not testable and hence, non-scientific.  A modified version of this theory is <em>Intelligent Design</em>, which states that life on Earth arose through the actions of an intelligent being and does not identify the creator or specify the means that were used to create life.  This solves the problem of what delivered the initial spark, where there is disagreement concerning how much involvement the intelligent being has with the seeds of life are planted.</p>
<p>If we presume that creation is generated supernaturally, then we leave the realm for which science can answer questions and our tools are no longer effective for separating fact from fiction.  <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick">Francis Crick</a> has suggested that life began on Earth when intelligent beings from a far-off planet delivered it (intentionally or not) by releasing bacteria from a spaceship (i.e., directed panspermia; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103573901103?via%3Dihub">Crick &amp; Orgel (1973)</a>).  This explanation is not very satisfying because it merely shifts the problem from the beginnings of life on Earth to the beginnings of life in the Universe, which is a much more untenable issue to investigate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="group-ii-improbable-event">
<h4><span class="section-number">5.1.1.2. </span>Group II: Improbable Event<a class="headerlink" href="#group-ii-improbable-event" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Another point of view is that life began through natural causes, but the events that lead to this process were extremely improbable.  From this premise, it follows that life anywhere (beyond this planet) may be rare and the remainder of the Universe may be barren.  Consider the following:</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>One has only to contemplate the magnitude of this task to concede that spontaneous generation is impossible, Yet we are here - as a result, I believe, of spontaneous generation.</p>
<p>Time is in fact the hero of the plot.  The time with which we have to deal is of the order of two billion years.  Given so much time, the `impossible’ becomes possible, the possible probable, and the probable virtually certain.  One has only to wait: time itself performs the miracles.</p>
<p class="attribution">—George Wald (<a class="reference external" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1954SciAm.191b..44W/abstract">1954</a>)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In our current thinking, the amount of time available is only <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\sim}500\)</span> Myr rather than 2 Gyr, though the maximum amount of space that can be used for random trials is presumably the same (i.e., the surface of the Earth and the areas that exchange material with it).  Both could be expanded greatly if the possibility of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia">panspermia</a> were taken into account.  Panspermia presumes that life can be spread from world to world by spores (or within meteors) through space.  Much of the Universe and much of the time since creation would then be available for trials on the origin of life.</p>
<p>An improbable event requires us to understand a bit about probability itself (i.e., What are the chances?).  Given the age of our Universe and that it’s filled with billions upon billions of stars, small improbabilities can multiply.  For example, how long would it take to generate the word “at” on my computer keyboard by random strokes?  Assume that I limit my strokes to the fifty keys that produce characters, and I could carry out one trial per second.  My chances would be 1 in 2500 (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(50^2 = 50 \times 50\)</span>), which means that I could expect to produce this word within about 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Suppose we raise the difficulty level: <em>What are the chances that I could type this line at random?</em>  The italicized sentence has 48 characters (ignoring the spaces).  The odds of getting the order completely correct would be 1 in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(50^{48}\)</span>, about 1 in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\times 10^{81}\)</span>!  If we consider 6 billion humans performing one trial per second and an Earth-like planet orbited every star within every Galaxy of the Universe ever since the Big Bang, then the odds would still be less than 1 in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{30}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The incredibly slim chances for success would be masked if one broke up that sentence into small fragments which were considered individually.  The chances for getting the first two characters right in a finite time would seem reasonable.  If we assume (wrongly) that the whole is the sum (rather than the product) of its parts, the entire sequence seems reasonable.  This type of reasoning  underlies much of the approach used for what is called <em>prebiotic synthesis</em>.  A number of steps is demonstrated separately in a laboratory, each under conditions that may have prevailed in one location or another on the early Earth.  The products of the reaction are then termed <em>prebiotic</em> a distinction that allows the experimenter to use any of the reactions in a subsequent prebiotic transformation.  Little consideration is given to the adverse probabilities generated by the numerous processes which are implied by the suggested sequence of steps.</p>
<p>This inevitably leads to odds that makes the overall process seem near miraculous.  With some good fortune, such an event (i.e., combination of the correct compounds for life) might have occurred within the history of the Universe, and given rise to us.  A consequence of this theory would be that separate origins of life would very rare in the Universe.  Panspermia would still be a possibility, but any life that we encountered elsewhere would then be related to our own.  Astrobiology would represent a simple extension of Earth biology.</p>

<p>In this viewpoint, life began through the inevitable consequences from the laws of nature.  There exists a principle of self-organization that has guided the development of the Universe from the Big Bang to the present.  Life is common in the Universe.  It will arise whenever a prerequisite set of materials interacts with a suitable energy source.  Life’s origin is not liked to the improbable formation of a particular functioning large biomolecule, and it requires a much simpler set of ingredients:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a suitable source of free energy,</p></li>
<li><p>a set of chemicals that can utilize energy to increase its own ability to survive, and</p></li>
<li><p>an environment that is sufficiently stable so that the evolving system is not disrupted by extreme changes in conditions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This theory encourages the expectation that life is likely to arise on other worlds that have enjoyed Earth-like conditions during some part of their history.  No recipe for a specific set of ingredients for life is offered.  The possibility remains open that alternative lifeforms may rise in environments that are very different than Earth but still meet the necessary requirements for life.  This stance towards the origin of life is the most optimistic for the field of astrobiology, but it remains to be demonstrated that it is correct.</p>

<p>For millennia, the consensus favored <em>spontaneous generation</em>, where life may arise quickly by chance from non-living matter and independent of the action of parents.  Aristotle and his followers claimed that fireflies emerged from morning dew from their many observations in which they suddenly appeared.  Many kinds of small animals seemed to arise from the mud at the bottom of ponds and streams.  The 17th century philosopher René Descartes suggested that the process was driven by heat agitating the subtle and dense particles of putrefying matter.</p>
<p>Through careful experimental tests to these speculative ideas, scientists found negative results for a whole array of lower lifeforms.  By the mid-19th century, the spontaneous generation question had contracted to the realm of microorganisms.</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>The cell theory was modified in the 1860s so that protoplasm came to be considered the structural unit of life.  Moreover, this protoplasm was viewed as an essentially simple substance, theoretically capable of bing produced directly from inorganic matter.  That the simples organism were generally regarded merely as naked lumps of protoplasm added credence to the belief that they, too, could be produced spontaneously.</p>

<p>The paradigm collapsed in the late 19th century as a result of the experiments of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>.  Pasteur proclaimed in an 1862 lecture at the Sorbonne, “never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow of this simple experiment.”  Pasteur heated and thus sterilized a broth of sugared yeast water, which showed that a solution could be devoid of life and did not spontaneously accumulate microbes until direct contact with the outside air was re-established.</p>
<p>Experiments similar to Pasteur’s demonstrated that all living things arise today from existing life.  The results were comforting to those with the Biblical-Creationist view, where a Creator was necessary to bring life to the world for the first time.  This included Pasteur himself:</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<div><p>What a victory for materialism if it could be affirmed that it rests on the established fact that matter organizes itself, takes on life itself, matter which has in it already all known forces! … Of what good would it be then to have recourse to the idea of a primordial creation, before which mystery it is necessary to bow?  What good then would be the idea of a Creator God?</p>

<p>A scientific (rather than theologic) view need to push the origin back to an earlier era when conditions on the Earth were very different, and when timespans greater than a few days could be invoked.

<h4><span class="section-number">5.1.2.2. </span>The Oparin-Haldane Hypothesis<a class="headerlink" href="#the-oparin-haldane-hypothesis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This theory proposed separately by <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Oparin">Alexander Oparin</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._S._Haldane">J.B.S. Haldane</a> stated that life arose slowly on the early Earth in a “prebiotic soup” of chemicals that covered the planet through a series of steps.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>The early Earth had an oxygen-free atmosphere, but contained ammonia, hydrogen gas, water, and methane (i.e., reduced carbon bound to hydrogen).</p></li>
<li><p>This atmosphere was exposed to a variety of energy sources: solar radiation, meteorite and comet infall, volcanic eruptions, lightning, and others, which led to the formation of organic compounds.</p></li>
<li><p>These substances “must have accumulated until the primitive oceans reached th consistency of hot dilute soup” as stated by Haldane.  <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Urey">Harold Urey</a> suggested that the soup components, “would remain for long periods of time in the primitive oceans. … This would provide a very favorable situation for the origin of life.”</p></li>
<li><p>By unspecified transformations, life developed in this soup.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Some elements of the hypothesis were demonstrated in a famous 1953 experiment by Urey and his student <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Miller">Stanley Miller</a>.  They set up a flask of boiling water to represent the oceans of the early Earth.  The water vapor passed through a compartment that held two electrodes and supported a spark discharge.  The spark served as an energy source and represented lightning.  After the vapors passed through the spark, they were condensed to water droplets that returned to the original flask.  The entire system was enclosed and filled with a mixture of methane, ammonia, and hydrogen gases to mimic the primitive atmosphere (as it was understood at the time).  The experiment was run for a week, in which all of the methane was consumed. <em>What was produced in its place?</em></p>
<p>The results apparently depended upon the arrangement of the compartments and the nature fo the spark.  The most exciting result was to produce a mixture containing amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.  In a modified design, a hydrocarbon layer was formed that was devoid of amino acids.  A later experiment, an intermittent spark was used, but few organic compounds were produced.  Further studies were carried out under the conditions that afforded amino acids.</p>

</div>
<p>The prominent product was a tar-like, insoluble substance that coated the walls of the vessel.  Fifteen percent of the methane had been converted to a mixture of simple organic compounds.  Fourteen of these compounds were present in yields over <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.1\%\)</span>.  All of the compounds were organic acids (i.e., carboxylic acids), which may have been preserved from destruction by their formation of non-volatile ammonium salts.  The salts would have remained in the liquid phase and evaded continuous recycling through the spark.  Two amino acids produced are used in life’s proteins, while the remainder are not.</p>
<p>The experiment did confirm one tenet of the hypothesis: that an atmosphere of methane, hydrogen, and ammonia, when exposed to certain types of energy, would afford a mixture of organic compounds.  It revealed nothing about the processes that produce a living organism from such a mixture.  As our understanding of the complexity of life has increased, that problem has become more difficult over the next 50+ years.</p>

<p>Historically, biologists used a “top-down” approach to understand life, where anatomical studies of larger (macro-sized) creatures first drew their interest.  Chemists worked in a “bottom-up” fashion and studied the molecular components of life before attempting to explore the larger structures.  Chemically, a bacterial cell is primarily composed of water (70% by weight), which serves as a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent">solvent</a>.  Hundreds of organic molecules are present, but they comprise only a few percent of the cell (by weight).</p>

<p><strong>Proteins</strong> control most cellular functions, where our muscles move through their contraction/relaxation.  The rotation of flagella (a protein structure) in bacteria allow them to swim.  Proteins can perform many more functions, such as</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>forming gateways in the cellular membranes constricting the movement of substances to enter or leave the cell.</p></li>
<li><p>transporting electrons via brigades within cellular organelles.</p></li>
<li><p>functioning as bioweapons and poisons (e.g., defensive antibodies).</p></li>
<li><p>forming a scaffolding for cells (e.g., the cartilage that forms our noses).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly they can act as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme">enzymes</a>, which speed up chemical reactions needed for life relative to benign or destructive reactions.  Proteins are composed of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid">amino acids</a>, where those used in living organisms contain the (arbitrarily called) left-handed form.  The reason for this selection is unclear, where it could be from physical processes arising from an environmental bias, simply arbitrary, or governed by some accident.  When looking for life elsewhere, we must acknowledge our own limited <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">ontology</a>.  It could be a boon, in that a strong signal for panspermia could be identified.  On the other hand, it could be our bane, where we are not initially equipped to detect such life.</p>
<p>The linear sequence of amino acids in a protein governs the way that it folds in 3D space, where <a class="reference external" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/02/23/1044957/ai-protein-folding-deepmind/">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> has come to the fore to increase our understanding.  Proteins produced by billions of years of evolution fold into distinct shapes, with charges at particular locations, and reactive groups in proximity to each other.  This folding will determine the biological function of a protein by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>whether it wil bind certain organic molecules and catalyze their reactions, or</p></li>
<li><p>form a regular structure (e.g., helix) and act as a binding material.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes proteins are created in the cell in a particular way and are later modified to meet a particular function.  In this case a protein may be altered by other proteins or may recruit an additional factor (e.g., organic molecule or inorganic ion).</p>
<p><strong>Nucleic acids</strong> store hereditary information and reproduce themselves (with the help of proteins).  An organelle called the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome">ribosome</a> can synthesize protein from amino acids, where the bacterial ribosome is made of 50+ proteins and 3 RNA molecules.  The RNA catalyzes the central step of the protein synthesis process, the linking of each new amino acid to the growing chain called a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide">polypeptide</a> chain.  Individual amino acids
are transported to the ribosome for manufacturing purposes by <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_RNA"><em>transfer</em> RNA</a>.</p>
<p>A bacterial cell man contain <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\sim}\text{20,000}\)</span> ribosomes able to produce several thousand proteins, where each ribosome can produce any of the proteins.  A ribosome determines which protein to manufacture through an information-bearing “tape” that threads through the ribosome.  This tape is made of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"><em>messenger</em> RNA</a>, which carries information in the sequence of <em>bases</em> (a subunit of a nucleotide) that project from the backbone of the RNA.  The bases of <strong>RNA</strong> are</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>adenine (A),</p></li>
<li><p>cytosine (C),</p></li>
<li><p>guanine, (G), and</p></li>
<li><p>uracil (U).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The recognition scheme of these bases is the so-called <em>genetic code</em>, and the overall process is called <em>translation</em>.</p>
<p>Messenger RNA is not the original source of the information, but it has been carried by DNA (i.e., holder of the master blueprint for the cell).  A portion of the information in DNA is read into a messenger in a process called <em>transcription</em>.  DNA exists as the famous double helix, where two DNA chains (polymers) wrap around one another and linked by an affinity through the well-known Watson-Crick pairs.  These pairs combine from similar bases as RNA, where DNA contains thymine (T) instead of uracil to make the code with combinations of A, T, C, and G.</p>

</div>
<p>Each chain contains all the information present in the double helix, where individual chains are complementary.  Once chain can thus be used as a template for the construction of the other from appropriate nucleotide subunits.  This process requires the assistance of a specialized protein enzyme called a <em>polymerase</em>, and other helpful proteins.  When a bacterial cell divides to give two daughters, the two DNA strands of its chromosome come apart, and each is copied to provide a complement.  Through replication, a complete chromosome for each daughter cell is provided.</p>
<p><strong>Lipids</strong> form a boundary, separating the contents of the cell from the external world.   This function prevents the contents of a cell from being dispersed into the broader environment.  This boundary must not be impermeable, where selective admission of nutrients is necessary for metabolic processes, waste needs to be removed, and undesired substances can be ejected.  The process for basic membrane construction is far less rigorous and information-rich than those for proteins and nucleic acids.</p>

The entropy of the system (measure of disorder) must increase, but entropy is also associated with probability (i.e., a probability of possible states).  The formation of an organized system from disorder is not forbidden, but highly improbable.  Living systems “pay” for their existence by creating more disorder elsewhere in the system.  For example, they may convert nutrients to simpler chemicals, but the process causes a release of heat to the general environment and increases the disorder of that environment.  <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain%27t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch"><em>There’s no such thing as a free lunch.</em></a></p>
<p>The spontaneous generation of a living bacterium from small molecules would be near-miraculous due to its interior complexity.  The odds that component atoms within a hot gas could self-assemble into a bacterium are more than astronomical (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\ \text{in } 10^{10^{11}}\)</span>; <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/6xE3AAAAIAAJ?hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiZ7Nvwvez4AhVMEGIAHcFZBFcQ7_IDegQIDxAE">Morowitz 1968</a>).  Matters might improve by thousands of orders of magnitude if we started with an appropriate mixture of small molecular species, but the overall prospect would still be hopeless.  To reduce the improbability, scientists have suggested that life began with only a very limited subset of the components of a bacterial cell.  The hart of the origin-of-life problem lies in finding the way in which the initial functioning system was formed from disorganized chemical mixtures produced by th normal processes of abiotic chemistry.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">5.1.4.2. </span>Separate Problems: Origin of Life vs. Origin of Organics<a class="headerlink" href="#separate-problems-origin-of-life-vs-origin-of-organics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In the early 19th century, many chemist felt that the distinction life and non-life lay in the very chemicals used to construct them.  Living system contained carbon and the chemicals in them were called “organic,” while substances considered to be inorganic (with some exceptions) had no carbon.  This distinction was erased in 1828, when <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_W%C3%B6hler">Friedrich Wöhler</a> prepared urea from another substance that was classified as organic.</p>
<p>We now recognize that mixtures of simple organic chemicals are produced in many location off this planet (e.g., carbonaceous chondrites, interstellar dust clouds, cometary tails, and the atmosphere of Titan). The most informative studies have been performed on meteorites, where they represent the products of authentic abiotic processes, and are amenable to detailed analyses in Earth-based laboratories.  The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murchison_meteorite">Murchison meteorite</a> has been subjected to extensive analysis.</p>
<p>The contents of the meteorite are quite complex, where the bulk of the carbon present is in the form of insoluble macromolecules and soluble organic compounds comprise 10-20%.  The most predominant chemical class is organic sulfonic acids, followed by polar aromatic hydrocarbons, and carboxylic acids.  Amino acids occur at levels between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10-100\)</span> ppm (1-2 orders of magnitudes lower than the aforementioned compounds), and the base components of nucleic acis at about 1 ppm.  Sugars and phosphate esters of all kinds are absent.  More than 70 amino acids have been detected in the Murchison meteorite, but only eight of the twenty needed for Earth-life were among them.</p>
<p>If we presume that life on Earth began amidst a chaotic chemical mixture, we must look for a pathway by which the smaller components could organize themselves.  Another question arises: <em>How did the components of that mixture come to be present on the early Earth?</em></p>
