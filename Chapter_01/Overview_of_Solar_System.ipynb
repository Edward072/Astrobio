    "\n",
    "The history of the planetary sciences begins before it even had a name for it.  Ancient civilizations noticed several 'stars' moved quickly in the night sky relative to much more numerous background stars.  The [Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_astronomy) called these objects **πλανήτης** (planētēs; wandering stars), or **planets**.  Ancient civilizations (e.g., Chinese, Persian, [Ancestral Puebloans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestral_Puebloans), Maya) that developed written language and/or drawings attested to their interest in comets, solar eclipses, and other celestial phenomena.  Some migratory birds (and potentially their ancestors the dinosaurs) use the patterns of stars in the night sky to guide their journeys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Renaissance and Enlightenment movements in western Europe (i.e., Copernican-Keplerian-Galilean-Netwonian revolution) resulted in a completely different view for the dimensions and dynamics of the Solar System.  Humanity's view of the relative sizes and masses of bodies that consititue the Solar System were drastically altered, including the forces that make them orbit one another.\n",

As you may expect, we don't know a lot of detail concerning these exoplanets, but many of the have gross properties (e.g., orbits, masses, radii) that are quite different than any object in the Solar System.  As a result, some of models of planet formation and evolution have been revised.\n",

    "**Jupiter** dominates the planets in the Solar System in terms of both its mass ($318\\ M_\\oplus$ [Earth masses] or $9.54 \\times 10^{-4}\\ M_\\odot$ [Solar masses]) and radius ($11.2\\ R_\\oplus$ [Earth radii] or $0.10\\ R_\\odot$ [Solar radii]).  Jupiter has two times more mass than the remainder of the Solar System (excluding the Sun).  The first approximation of the Solar System was the Sun + debris, where a second approximation would be the Sun + Jupiter + debris.  The largest (in mass and radius) of the new debris category is **Saturn**, which is about one-third of Jupiter's mass ($100\\ M_\\oplus$) and nearly equivalent to Jupiter's radius ($9.5\\ R_\\oplus$). Saturn is compositionally similar to Jupiter, where they are both comprised mostly of molecular hydrogen $(\\rm H_2)$ and helium $(\\rm He)$.  Both planets likely possess a heavy 'core' of $\\sim 10\\ M_\\oplus$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Astronomers use the term *ices* (or [interstellar ices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_ice)) to describe molecules or compounds that condense into crystals and are typically suspended within a gas cloud.  Examples of water ice on Earth are snow, sleet, and hail, where astrophysical ices are more similar to snow or sleet.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uranus** and **Neptune** are the next largest planets, but they are much less massive ($14\\ M_\\oplus$ and $17\\ M_\\oplus$, respectively) and physically smaller ($\\sim 4\\ R_\\oplus$) than the Jovian planets.  These planets belong to a different class, with most of their masses provided by a combination of three astrophysical *ices*:\n",

    "The four largest planets are known collectively as the **giant planets**, where they are subdivided into the **gas giants** (i.e., Jupiter and Saturn) and the **ice giants** (Uranus and Neptune).  All four giant planets possess strong magnetic fields.  The giant planets orbit at progressively farther distances from the Sun: 5.2 AU (Jupiter), 9.5 AU (Saturn), 19.2 AU (Uranus), and 30 AU (Neptune).\n",

    "The total mass of the remaining *debris* (in Sun + gas giants + debris) is less than one-fifth of Uranus' mass and their angular momenta are much smaller too.  The remaining debris consists of solid bodies, that are interesting chemically, geologically, dynamically, and in the case of Earth, biologically.  The two largest **terrestrial** planets are **Earth** and **Venus**.  Venus orbits closer to the Sun (0.72 AU), is less massive $(0.82\\ M_\\oplus)$, and is slightly smaller $(0.94\\ R_\\oplus)$ than the Earth.  Our Solar System contains two other terrestrial planets that are much smaller than the Earth: **Mars** $(0.53\\ R_\\oplus)$ and **Mercury** $(0.38\\ R_\\oplus)$.  These terrestrial worlds are much less massive than the Earth too: Mars $(0.11\\ M_\\oplus)$ and Mercury $(0.06\\ M_\\oplus)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "All four terrestrial planets have atmospheres, where the composition and density varies widely.  Venus' atmosphere is the thickest, while Mercury's atmosphere is the most tenuous.  Even though Venus' atmosphere is massive by terrestrial standards, it is still miniscule compared to the giant planets.  Earth and Mercury have an internally generated magnetic field.  Mars' magnetic field is extremely weak now, but it may have been stronger earlier in its history.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minor Planets and Comets\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Kuiper belt** consists of a thick disk of small bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune.  These bodies are composed of a mixture of ice and rock, where the two largest members are **Eris** and **Pluto**.  These Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) have eccentric orbits, which means that their **heliocentric distance** oscillates over a single orbit.  Eris lies between $38-97\\ \\rm AU$, while Pluto's distance varies between $29-50\\ \\rm AU$.  The radii of Eris and Pluto are greater than 1000 km $(\\sim 0.18\\ R_\\oplus)$.  On July 14 2015, the [New Horizons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons) space probe characterized [Pluto's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Pluto), although it was known to have an atmosphere since the 1980s.  Many other KBOs have been cataloged, but the census of these objects is still incomplete.\n",

    "A [minor planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_planet) directly orbits the Sun.  It is neither a planet nor exclusively classified as a comet.  Minor planets include **asteroids** (i.e., near-Earth objects, Mars-crossers, main-belt asteroids, and Jupiter trojans), as well as distant minor planets (centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects). As of June 2021, there are 1,086,655 known objects, divided into 567,132 numbered (secured discoveries) and 519,523 unnumbered minor planets, with only five of those officially recognized as a dwarf planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comets** are ice-rich objects (i.e., dirty snowballs) that shed mass when subjected to solar heating (inside of Jupiter's orbit).  Comets may have formed near the giant planet region initially, but were transported and stored in the **Oort Cloud**, Kuiper Belt, or the **scattered disk**.  The Oort cloud is a nearly spherical region that extends to $\\sim 10^4\\ \\rm AU$.  Scattered disk objects (SDOs) have moderate to high eccentricity orbits that lie wholly (or at least partially) withing the Kuiper belt.  The total number of comets (larger than 1 km in radius) in the entire Oort cloud is estimated to range from $\\sim 10^{12}-10^{13}$.  The total number of KBOs of a similar size is estimated to be $\\sim 10^8-10^{10}$.\n",

    "The smallest bodies known to orbit the Sun have been observed collectively, but not yet individually detected, via remote sensing.  Dust grains that together produce the faint band in the planet orbital plane are known as the **zodiacal cloud**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Satellite and Ring Systems\n",
    "Beyond those bodies orbiting the Sun are some of the most interesting objects in the Solar System, which in turn orbit the planets.  Two of the planetary satellites (Jupiter's moon Ganymede and Saturn's moon Titan) are slightly larger than the planet Mercury.  These bodies are half as massive as Mercury, where a large portion of their mass is dominated by ices.  Titan's atmosphere is about four times denser than Earth's atmosphere.  Neptune's moon Triton has an atmosphere that is much less dense, but it has powerful winds that strongly perturb particles ejected from geysers on its surface.  Very tenuous atmospheres have been detected on the Moon (Earth's satellite), Io (Jupiter's satellite), and Enceladus (Saturn's satellite).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural satellites** orbit most of the planets in the Solar System (only Mercury and Venus are without natural satellites).  Even KBOs and asteroids can have natural satellites.  The giant planets have large satellite systems consisting of moons of many sizes and rings.  Most of the smaller moons were discovered from spacecraft flybys.  All major satellites (except Triton) orbit in the direction of the host planet's rotation (i.e., **prograde**) and close to the planet's equatorial plane.  Small close-in moons also inhabit low-inclination, low-eccentricity orbits, but small, distant moons can travel around the planet in the direction opposite of the planet's rotation (i.e., **retrograde**) as well as prograde.  Moreover, such moons are often in highly inclined and eccentric orbits.\n",

    "Earth and Pluto each have a satellite that is very massive compared to the host planet.  Our Moon is about 1.67% of Earth's mass, where Charon is about 10% of Pluto's mass.  These moons aer suspected to have been produced through giant impacts when the Solar System was much younger.  Two tiny moons (Phobos & Deimos) travel on low-inclination, low-eccentricity orbits around Mars.  Current models suggest that Phobos will eventually (in millions of years) fall towards Mars and disrupt to form a planetary ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four giant planets all have ring system, which are primarily located within about 2.5 $R_p$ (planetary radii) from the planet's center.  The character of each ring system varies greatly, where Saturn's rings are bright, broad, and full of structure (such as density waves, gaps, and spokes).  Jupiter's ring is very tenuous and mostly consists of small particles.  Uranus has nine narrow, opaque rings and broad dust regions orbiting in the planet's equatorial plane.  Neptune has four rings (two narrow and two broad), where the narrow rings have bright segments called *ring arcs*.\n",

    "### Heliosphere\n",
    "\n",
    "All planetary orbits lie within the region of space containing the Sun's magnetic fields and ionized gas called the **heliosphere**.  The **solar wind** consists of ionized gas (i.e., **plasma**) that travels outward from the at high speed ($\\sim 400\\ {\\rm km/s}$).  The solar wind merges with the **interstellar medium** (ISM) at the boundary of the heliosphere called the **heliopause**.  Three interstellar probes (Voyager 1, Voyager 2, and Pioneer 10) are currently beyond the heliopause.\n",
    "\n",
    "The composition of the heliosphere is dominated by protons and electrons from the solar wind, where there are about $5 \\times 10^6\\ {\\rm protons/m^3}$ that intersect Earth's orbit at 1 AU.  The density of the solar wind decreases following an inverse square law ($\\rho \\propto 1/r^2$).  The solar wind reaches $\\sim 400\\ {\\rm km/s}$ near the Sun's equatorial plane, but its speed increases to $\\sim 800\\ {\\rm km/s}$ closer to the poles.\n",

The Sun's motion relative to its neighboring stars is about $18\\ {\\rm km/s}$, where the heliosphere also moves through the ISM at this speed (i.e., Galilean relativity).  When medium A travels through another (less dense) medium B, the shape of medium A can conform into a teardrop with a tail in the downwind direction.  This happens on Earth for raindrops falling through the atmosphere.  The heliosphere is believed to be shaped in a similar way as it moves through the ISM.  Interstellar ions and electrons generally flow around the heliosphere because they cannot cross the solar magnetic field lines.  Neutral atoms can enter the heliosphere, where the $\\rm H$ and $\\rm He$ atoms from the ISM move in the downstream direction with a speed of $\\sim 15-20\\ {\\rm km/s}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solar wind is slowed at a boundary just interior to the heliopause called its **termination shock**.  The location of this shock moves radially with respect to the Sun in accordance with the 11-year solar activity cycle and variations in the solar wind pressure.  The region between the termination shock and the heliopause is called the **heliosheath**."

The true anomaly defines where the planet is located along the ellipse, and is sometimes denoted by the greek letter $\\nu$.  An alternative angle called the longitude of pericenter or `varpi` is simply the sum of the argument of pericenter with the longitude of ascending node for prograde orbits (i.e., $\\varpi = \\omega + \\Omega$).  For retrograde orbits, `varpi` is defined as the *difference* between the respective angles.  \n",

    "Alternative sets of orbital elements are also possible.  For example, an orbit is fully specified by the planet's Cartesian location and velocity relative to the Sun at a given time (epoch), which requires six independent scalar quantities, provided the masses of the Sun and the planet are known.\n",

    "Kepler's laws can be derived from Newton's [laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion) and [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation) that were developed in the 17th century.  In most instances, this is sufficient where corrections (through [General Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity)) to Newton's laws are necessary when a planet orbits sufficiently close to the Sun.  Otherwise, planetary orbits can be modeled using classical methods that account for the gravitational perturbations between planets and the gravitational force exerted by the Sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "All planets and asteroids revolve around the Sun in the direction of solar rotation.  Their orbital planes generally lie within a few degrees of each other and are close to the solar equator.  For observational convenience, inclinations are usually measured relative to the Earth's orbital plane (i.e., the **ecliptic plane**).  The Sun's equatorial planet is tilted by $7^\\circ$ from the ecliptic.  Mercury's orbit is also tilted $7^\\circ$ from the ecliptic, but it is tilted $3.4^\\circ$ from the Sun's equatorial plane due to its ascending node and the [spherical law of cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_law_of_cosines).  The other major planets all lie nearly in the plane of the ecliptic.  Most major satellites also orbit within their host planet's equatorial plane.  Some comets and satellites orbit opposite to the Sun's or planet's rotation (i.e., retrograde).\n",

    "### Mass\n",
    "The mass of an object can be deduced from the gravitational force that it exerts on other bodies through the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Orbits of moons**: The orbital periods of natural satellites and Newton's generalization of Kepler's 3rd law can be applied to determine the mass of the host planet $M_p$.  The result is actually the sum of the masses between the planet and satellite, but to a first good approximation it represents the planet mass (i.e., $M_p \\approx M_p + M_{\\rm sat}$).  For massive moons (e.g., Earth/Moon or Pluto/Charon), the approximation breaks down and other methods are needed.  The major source of uncertainty in this method lies in measurement errors in the semimajor axis, where timing errors are negligible.  \n",
    "- **Gravitational perturbations**: The gravity of planetary neighbors is sometimes sufficient to allow for a mass measurement.  The accuracy for this method is not as high because of the large distances involved.  The timing differences on the observed body has been used to discover and confirm a host of exoplanets.  Additionally, Neptune was discovered using variations in the motion of Uranus.\n",
    "- **Spacecraft tracking**: The motions of planets and moons can be identified through the Doppler shift in a radio signal, which correlates to the mass of each body very precisely.  The long time baselines from **orbiter** missions allow much higher accuracy than for **flyby** missions.  Some of the outer planet moons were measured by flyby measurements with the *Voyager* tracking data.\n",
    "- **Spiral density waves**: The masses of Saturn's inner moons can be derived from the amplitude of spiral density waves resonantly excited within Saturn's rings.\n",
    "- **Nongravitational forces**: The masses of some objects can be crudely estimated by the asymmetric escape of gas and dust, where this affects the observed orbit.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The gravity field of a non-spherically symmetric mass distribution differs from a point source of identical mass.  Such deviations can be used to estimate the degree of central mass concentration in rotating bodies, if the rotation period is well known.  This effect is most pronounced for points close to the rotating body.  One can make use of spacecraft tracking data and the orbits of moons/rings to determine the precise gravity field. \n",

    "### Size\n",
    "Bodies in the Solar System occur in a broad range of shapes and sizes.  The planets are nearly round (see Fig. {numref}`{number}<planet-sizes-fig>`), but asteroids and comets come in a wider variety of shapes (e.g., potato and dog-bone).  The size of an object can be measured in various ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Angular size and Distance**: The diameter of a body $d_b$ is the product of its angular size $\\theta$ (in radians) with its distance $d_o$ from the observer (i.e., $d_b \\approx d_o\\theta$).  Solar System distances are simple to estimate from orbits (via parallax).  The limited resolution from ground-based observations results in large uncertainties in angular size.  For bodies below this resolution limit, it is better to measure the size at close distances by interplanetary spacecraft.\n",
    "- **Occultation**:  The diameter of a body can be deduced by observing a background star that is being blocked (i.e., occulted) by the body in the foreground.  The angular velocity $\\dot{\\theta}$ of the star relative to the body can be calculated using orbital data (after accounting for observational effects of Earth's orbit and rotation).  An estimate for the distance across a body (i.e., a chord) can be determined by measuring the duration of the occultation $\\Delta t_{occ}$, and then multiplying by the angular velocity and distance (i.e., $d_b \\approx \\dot{\\theta} \\Delta t_{occ} d_o$).  Three well-separated chords are sufficient for a spherical planet, but many chords are needed if the body is irregularly shaped.  This technique is useful for small bodies and requires an intense amount of planning to obtain enough chords.\n",
    "- **Radar**: Similar to mapping the ocean floor or identifying aircraft, the echoes of a wave can be used to determine radii and shapes.  The signal strength of radar drops as $1/r^4$ because it falls as $1/r^2$ on the outgoing trip and $1/r^2$ again on the return trip.  This limits this technique to relatively nearby objects, such as solid planets, asteroids, and cometary nuclei.\n",
    "- **Lander and Orbiter**: An excellent way to measure the radius is through the use of a lander and orbiter using triangulation.  This method works well for terrestrial planets and satellites with substantial atmospheres (e.g., Titan).\n",
    "- **Photometric Observations**:  The reflection of light (i.e., albedo) at visible and infrared (IR) wavelengths can be used to measure the size.  The resulting lightcurve from these observations can be numerically modeled to determine its shape.  Variations of this method have been used to measure the sizes for 1000s of exoplanets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean density $\\rho$ of an object can be trivially determined after both the mass and size are measured (i.e., $\\rho = \\text{mass}/\\text{volume}$).  The density of an object gives a rough idea of its composition, although compression at high pressures must also be taken into account or the possibility of significant voids.  The low density $\\sim 0.6-1.7\\ {\\rm g/cm^3}$ of the four giant planets implies material with low mean molecular weight.  Terrestrial planet densities $(\\sim 3-5.5\\ {\\rm g/cm^3})$ imply rocky material including silicates and some metal.  Most of the medium-large satellites orbiting giant planets have low densities $(1-2\\ {\\rm g/cm^3})$, which implies a combination of high density rock with low density ice; recall the density of water is $1\\ {\\rm g/cm^3}$ and water ice is $0.917\\ {\\rm g/cm^3}$.  Comets have densities nearly equal to water ice. \n",
    "\n",
    "The escape velocity can be determined using the mass and size of an object.  The escape velocity and temperature can be used to estimate a planetary body's ability to retain an atmosphere.  Both of these effects are related to measuring a planet's gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rotation\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotation is a vector quantity (having a magnitude and direction) that is related to the spin angular momentum.  The **obliquity** (or **axial tilt**) of a planetar body is the angle between its spin and orbital angular momentum (see Fig. {numref}`{number}<planet-rotation-fig>`).  A body with an obliquity $<90^\\circ$ is defined to have a **prograde** rotation (i.e., the spin and orbit are along the same direction), where as a **retrograde** body has an obliquity $>90^\\circ$.  *Note that these terms are not to be confused with prograde or retrograde orbits.*\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The rotation of an object can be determine using various techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Surface Markings**:  The most straightforward method to determine a body's rotation axis and period is to observe how markings on the surface move around with the disk.  Such markings can include uniquely sized or shaped impact craters; persistent cloud formations; or starspots (i.e., magnetic field interactions with a plasma).  Not all planets have such features (e.g., Venus).  If atmospheric features are used, winds may cause the deduced period to vary with latitude, altitude, and time.\n",
    "- **Magnetic Fields**:  Bodies with sufficient magnetic fields trap charged particles within their magnetospheres.  These charged particles are accelerated by electromagnetic forces and emit radio waves.  The radio signals have a periodicity that is equal to the rotation of the planet.  For planets *without* solid surfaces, the magnetic field period is viewed as more fundamental than the periods measured with clout features.\n",
    "- **Photometric Observations**:  The brightness variations of an object is measured as a **lightcurve** (i.e., total disk brightness as a function of time).  The variations can be the result of differences in albedo or projected area (for irregularly shaped bodies).  Most asteroids have double-peaked lightcurves, indicating that the variations are due to the shape.\n",
    "- **Doppler Shifts**:  The measured Doppler shift across the disk can give a rotation period and a crude estimate of the rotation axis, if the body's radius is known.  This can be done passively in visible light, or actively using radar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rotation periods of most objects orbiting the Sun range from $3$ hours to a few days.  Mercury and Venus form exceptions with periods of 59 and 243 days, respectively, and are partially explained by the slowing effect of solar tides.  Most Solar System planets (6 out of 8) rotate in a prograde sense with a respective obliquity that is $\\leq  30^\\circ$.  Venus and Uranus rotate in a retrograde direction with an obliquity of $177^\\circ$ and $98^\\circ$, respectively.  Most planetary satellites rotate synchronously with their orbital periods (i.e., $P_{\\rm orb} \\approx P_{\\rm rot}$) as a result of planet-induced tides.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shape\n",
    "\n",
    "Many different forces together determine the shape of a body.  Self-gravity tends to produce bodies of a spherical shape, which is a consequence of a minimum for gravitational potential energy.  Material strength maintains shape irregularities, which are produced by accretion, impacts, or internal geological processes.  Bodies with mean radii larger than $\\sim 200\\ {\\rm km}$ are fairly round, and smaller objects may be quite oddly shaped.

    "### Temperature\n",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet can be estimated from the energy balance between the incoming solar radiation (i.e., insolation) and the outgoing long-wave radiation back into space.  Internal heat sources provide a significant contribution to the energy balance of many planets.  Daily (diurnal), latitudinal, and seasonal effects can induce temperature variations.  The **greenhouse effect** raises the surface temperature on som planets far above the equilibrium temperature, where the atmosphere behaves like a thermal 'blanket' that is more transparent to visible radiation and prevents the escape of longer-wavelength infrared (IR) radiation.\n",

    "The thermal IR spectrum of a body's emitted radiation is also a good indicator of the temperature of its surface or cloud tops.  Most solid and liquid planetary material can be characterized as a nearly perfect blackbody with an emission peak in the near- to mid-IR wavelengths.  However, the analysis of emitted radiation sometimes gives different temperatures at differing wavelengths.  This could be due to combination of temperatures at different locations on the surface, such as pole-to-equator differences, albedo variations, or volcanic hot spots (e.g., the surface of Io).  The opacity of an atmosphere varies with wavelength, which allows us to remotely probe different altitudes in a planetary atmosphere (e.g., giant planets).\n",

    "\n",
    "Magnetic fields are created by moving charges (i.e., currents).  Currents through a solid medium decay quickly due to friction and/or heat, unless the medium is a superconductor.  Internally generated magnetic fields must be produced by a (poorly understood) [dynamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory) process, which can only operate in a fluid region of a planet or be caused by **remnant ferromagnetism** (i.e., charges within a solid that are locked in an aligned configuration).  Remnant ferromagnetism is not favored because it would require the planet to have been caught in a nearly constant (in direction) magnetic field during its early evolution when the bulk of its iron cooled through its [Curie temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curie_temperature).  Magnetic fields may also be induced through the interaction between the solar wind and conducting regions within the planet or its ionosphere.\n",

For very small phase angles, this increase can be much more rapid and is known as the **opposition effect**.\n",

    "### Atmosphere\n",
    "Most of the major planets (and Titan) are surrounded by significant atmospheres.  The giant planets are basically huge fluid balls, where their atmospheres are dominated by $\\rm H_2$ and $He$.

The gravitational field can be measured from spacecraft tracking or from the orbits of satellites/rings.  Seismology provides more detailed information on the internal structure of a planet.  The velocities and attenuation of seismic waves depend on the density, rigidity, composition, and temperature of the interior.  Reflection and refraction off internal boundaries provide information on layering.  The free oscillation periods of gaseous planets (e.g., [kronoseismology](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kronoseismology)) and stars (e.g., [helioseismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helioseismology)) provides important information regarding the respective interiors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The response of moons that are subject to significant time-dependent tidal deformations depends on their internal structure.  Repeated observations can reveal the presence of a subsurface ocean.  Measurements of the gravity field with altitude could show the extent of lateral inhomogeneities under the surface of icy moons and infer the presence of volcanic sources and tectonic structures that could melt the ice.  Conducting fluid regions within a planetary interior are believed to be responsible for substantial magnetic fields.  Centered dipole fields are probably produced in or near the core of the planet, whereas highly irregular offset fields are likely produced closer to the planet's surface."

Observational evidence for analogs of a Solar System-like disks around young stars has increase substantially with observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array ([ALMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Large_Millimeter_Array)).

At sufficient distances from the central star, it is cool enough for $\\sim1-2\\%$ of the material to condense (i.e., cool) into either remnant interstellar grains or other solids.  The dust is primarily composed of rock-forming compounds within a few AU of the host star, where solids in the outer regions grow along with ices (e.g., $\\rm H_2O$, $\\rm CH_4$, and $\\rm CO$).\n",
    "\n",
    "During the infall stage, the disk is very active and probably highly turbulent.  Gravitational instabilities along with viscous and magnetic forces may add to the activity.  When the infall slows substantially or stops, the disk becomes more quiescent (i.e., inactive).  Interactions with the gaseous component of the disk affect the dynamics of small bodies, where they can grow from micron-sized ($\\mu \\rm m$) dust into kilometer-sized planetesimals.  The details for this growth is still an active field of research today.  Meteorites, minor planets, and comets best preserve a record of the important period in Solar System development.\n",

    "The dynamics of larger solid bodies within protoplanetary disks are better characterized.  The primary perturbations on these bodies are mutual gravitational interactions and physical collisions.  Some interactions lead to collisions of planetesimals that are accretionary, where the incident bodies combine to form a larger object.  However, some collisions actually lead to erosion (partial breakup) or complete fragmentation depending on the impact geometry or velocity.  Eventually solid bodies grow into the terrestrial planets in the Solar System or into $\\sim 10\\ M_\\oplus$ planetary cores in the outer Solar System.  The more massive cores are able to gravitationally attract and retain the leftover gas from the protoplanetary disk.  In contrast, terrestrial planets accumulated only a small portion of the gas and were not massive enough to retain it against erosion from the solar wind.  The gases (and water) in the current atmospheres of the terrestrial planets are derived from the planetary interior, which held material from the solid planetesimals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The planets in our Solar System orbit close enough to one another that the final phases of planetary growth could have involved the merger or ejection of planets or planetary embryos on unstable orbits.  Since the outer planets have such low eccentricities in their orbits, it appears that some damping process (e.g., accretion, ejection of numerous small planetesimals, or interactions with residual gas within the protoplanetary disk) must have been involved."
