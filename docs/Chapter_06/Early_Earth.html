<p>The process of metabolism is a hallmark of all living organisms.  <em><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism">Catabolic</a> reactions generate energy for the organism while <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism">anabolic</a> reactions are used for the synthesis of cell material.</em>  Metabolic pathways in today’s living organisms have been evolving for more than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3.5\ {\rm Gyr}\)</span>.  The evolution of metabolism cannot be separated from the origin life because it was necessary for even the earliest organisms.  Contemporary metabolic pathways are presumed to be much more elaborate and sophisticated that those first evolved.  Metabolism today ranges from</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the use of various inorganic chemicals (e.g., hydrogen or sulfur for energy),</p></li>
<li><p>several forms of photosynthesis, and</p></li>
<li><p>metabolism of hundreds of organic compounds.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is presently impossible for us to know which pathways originated first and how they evolved.  Understanding how metabolism evolved on the early Earth is of considerable importance.  Microorganisms resembling today’s Bacteria and Archaea were most likely the first organisms, and the evolution of their metabolism is the most relevant.  Identifying the early evolution of metabolism in these organisms enables us to distinguish specific metabolic types from the later innovations.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-setting-conditions-on-early-earth">
<h3><span class="section-number">6.1.1. </span>The Setting: Conditions on Early Earth<a class="headerlink" href="#the-setting-conditions-on-early-earth" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>On the early Earth, there were <em>physical</em> and <em>chemical</em> conditions that influenced the evolution of metabolic processes.</p>
<p>One factor that influenced physical conditions was instability in the environment (e.g., large changes in available sunlight, water, or temperature).An impact of an asteroid (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R{\sim}50\ {\rm km}\)</span>; see Fig. <a class="reference internal" href="../Chapter_05/Tree_of_Life.html#impact-frustration-fig"><span class="std std-numref">5.16</span></a>) can sterilize all surface life on our planet and evaporate a global ocean that is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3\ {\rm km}\)</span> deep.  Only microbial ife at a depth of several <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm km}\)</span> could then survive.  Cosmic events affected early life in major and largely unknown ways that may have lead to the extinction of many species and redirection of the evolution of Earth’s biota.  It is possible that catastrophic events during the early history of Earth may have also affected the evolution of metabolism.</p>
<p>Chemical conditions on early Earth were marked by a relative dearth (absence) of nutrients that make life so rich today.  A steady supply of certain nutrients was available, which may have influenced the emergence of specific metabolic pathways.  Organic and other volatile materials are synthesized in space and became incorporated into the Earth through impacts by large bodies.  These impacts may have disrupted evolution, but also provided nutrients for life.  In addition, the abiotic synthesis of organic molecules occurred on Earth.  Acetic acid (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm CH_3COOH\)</span>) synthesis has been shown to occur under primordial conditions.</p>
<p>Although on the early Earth organic materials were less abundant than today, we may reasonably assume that they were present in sufficient quantities and varieties for life to originate and evolve.  Organic materials alone would not likely have been sufficient to sustain life.  Other nutrients were necessary for organisms to utilize electron donors and acceptors to generate metabolic energy needed for life (see Table <a class="reference internal" href="#nutrient-table"><span class="std std-numref">6.1</span></a>).  The first metabolisms that arose were carried out <em>anaerobically</em> due to the lack of free oxygen.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.1.2. </span>Evidence for the Nature of Early Metabolisms<a class="headerlink" href="#evidence-for-the-nature-of-early-metabolisms" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>A few categories of more direct evidence can elucidate the nature and timing of early metabolisms.  This evidence comes from three primary sources: <strong>biomarkers</strong>, <strong>the geochemical record</strong>, and <strong>phylogenetic evidence</strong>.</p>
<p>Unique biomarkers have been useful for understanding early metabolisms.  Fro example, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopanoids">hopanoids</a> are found only in cell membranes of the bacterial group <em>cyanobacteria</em>, which carryout oxygen-producing photosynthesis.  The presence of hopanoids has been used to date the evolution of these organisms to about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.5\ {\rm Ga}\)</span>.  This date agrees well with the geochemical record for oxygen production on Earth and supports the view that the first oxygenic photosynthetic organisms were cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>The geochemical record has been useful in establishing evidence for certain types of metabolic activity.  Strong evidence indicates that carbon dioxide fixation was an early metabolic event on Earth, which is called <em>primary production</em>.  This is when environmental <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm CO_2}\)</span> is taken up and the carbon is incorporated into organic matter.  Carbon dioxide fixing organisms cause isotopic fractionation.  As a result in the Isua deposits in Greenland (that date to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3.5\ {\rm Ga}\)</span>), deposited organic carbon has a lighter isotopic signature than carbonate.</p>
<p>Although this is excellent evidence that primary production occurred on early Earth, there is no definitive evidence about the nature of the earliest primary producing organisms.  Were they using chemical energy (chemosynthetic) or light energy (photosynthetic), and which organisms were responsible for this process?  The anaerobic methane oxidizing microbes are known to produce the lightest organic carbon, which may explain the existence of lighter organic carbon isotopes in certain layers of the Isua sediments.</p>
<p>Phylogenetic analysis is another useful approach for identifying which bacterial groups were involved in early metabolism.  By knowing which group of organisms evolved first, it is possible to hypothesize which metabolic activities arose first.  The deepest branches of the RNA Tree of Life are of thermophilic Archaea and Bacteria, implying that these are the earliest ancestors of any organisms still alive today.  However, two issues are important:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>discernible detail regarding the major groups of microorganisms is in adequate, so there remains a question about which organisms might have been the earliest; and</p></li>
<li><p>horizontal gene transfer, which involves the exchange of genes among different lineages.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Most genes are transferred by vertical inheritance from one generation to another within a species.</p>
<p>Some of the genes responsible for carrying out methanogenesis (methane production) have also been found in bacteria that are methane consumers.  Methanogens are found in the domain Archaea, whereas methane consumers are found in the domain Bacteria.  This sort of horizontal gene transfer makes it very difficult to trace the evolution of metabolic functions and other characteristics of organisms.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.1.3. </span>Contemporary Metabolisms<a class="headerlink" href="#contemporary-metabolisms" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The evolution of life has changed the Earth, even as the Earth has provided the habitats for life.  For example the volution of oxygenic photosynthesis gave rise to oxygen on Earth and enabled the later evolution of aerobic metabolism.  To understand the evolution of metabolism, we study the essential metabolic features of present-day organisms.</p>
<div class="section" id="anabolism">
<h4><span class="section-number">6.1.3.1. </span>Anabolism<a class="headerlink" href="#anabolism" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>One of the two major parts of metabolism is <em>anabolism</em> (i.e., constructive metabolism or biosynthesis), which is responsible for the building of new cell material for growth and reproduction.  The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotroph">heterotrophs</a> synthesize cell material from organic molecules that are present in their environment.  In contrast, the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotroph">autotrophs</a> make organic molecules from carbon dioxide in a process called carbon dioxide fixation.  The autotrophs are important because they are the <em>primary producers</em> that ultimately provide the entire biosphere with organic material.</p>
<p>The most advanced pathway for carbon dioxide fixation is the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_cycle">Calvin-Benson</a> cycle used by plants and some bacteria as part of photosynthesis.  Other pathways include the acetyl coenzyme A, reverse tricarboxylic acid, and hydroxypropionate pathways.</p>

<div class="section" id="catabolism">
<h4><span class="section-number">6.1.3.2. </span>Catabolism<a class="headerlink" href="#catabolism" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The chemical reactions that constitute metabolism must be thermodynamically feasible.  Anabolic reactions require energy to create order, and thus organism must also have <em>catabolic</em> pathways (i.e., destructive metabolism) to generate energy needed for anabolism.  Catabolic pathways are remarkably diverse, where some organism “burn” organic food using oxygen (i.e., aerobic organotropy).  Before oxygen, organisms “breathed” substances such as carbon dioxide, sulfate, iron, and other substances.  The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithotroph">lithotrophs</a> “eat” hydrogen, sulfur, ammonia, and other unlikely-seeming foods.  The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototroph">phototrophs</a> harvest the energy of light.</p>

<div class="section" id="oxidation-reduction-and-electron-flow">
<h4><span class="section-number">6.1.3.3. </span>Oxidation, reduction, and electron flow<a class="headerlink" href="#oxidation-reduction-and-electron-flow" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>Catabolism follows the principles of oxidation and reduction.  These principles are best illustrating using a form of catabolism called <em>respiration</em>.  For respirers, oxidation corresponds to “eating” as reduction is to “breathing.”  Between the two types of reactions, electrons flow and the work done using catabolic energy is analogous to the work done by electrons flowing between the terminals of a battery. The only requirement is that the reaction has the potential to release energy, which condition is realized if the substance oxidized has a more negative electrical potential than the substance reduced.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>To generate energy the organism oxidizes (or “eats”) the <em>electron donor</em>, while it reduces (or “breathes”) the <em>electron receptor</em>.</p></li>

<p>Respirers range from methanogens and acetogens, which utilize carbon dioxide and produce methane and acetic acid as waste products, to aerobes (which use oxygen and produce water).  The electron acceptor has also been a major constraint in the evolution of catabolism because electron acceptors (e.g., oxygen) became abundant relatively late.</p>

<p>The three forms of catabolism are <strong>respiration</strong>, <strong>photosynthesis</strong>, and <strong>fermentation</strong>, which are distinguished largely by their patterns of electron flow.  Respiration is the most straightforward because separate substances in the environment (i.e., <em>substrate</em>) are used by organism as electron donor and acceptor.  In photosynthesis and fermentation, electrons still flow from a donor to an acceptor, but the pattern is less intuitive.</p>
<p><em>Photosynthesizers</em> take advantage of the key property of chlorophyll, which functions well as an electron acceptor and an effective electron donor (if energized by light).  As a result, electrons flow from and to chlorophyll in a cyclic pattern, doing work in the process.  Superimposed on this chlorophyll-driven cyclic electron flow, electrons from an electron-donating substrate are used to reduce carbon dioxide in carbon dioxide fixation.  <em>Fermenters</em> have a pattern, where an electron-donating substrate is oxidized and the electron acceptor is an internal metabolic intermediate rather than a substrate.</p>

<p>Catabolism consists of metabolic pathways that involve oxidation and reduction.  <em>How is the energy actually stored and transferred?</em>  Adenosine triphosphate (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate">ATP</a>) is the energy currency of biology, ATP contains <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-energy_phosphate">phosphoanhydride</a> bonds that yield energy upon hydrolysis (i.e., breakdown through combination of water).  Certain other compounds have energy-rich bonds too, including adenosine diphosphate (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate">ADP</a>), pyrophospate (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrophosphate">PP</a>), and other metabolic intermediates.  ATP predominates in present-day organisms.</p>
<p>The formation of ATP and the hydrolysis of ATP provide the energy link between catabolism and anabolism, where the former generates ATP and the latter uses ATP.  The mechanism of ATP generation is usually simplest in the case of <em>fermentation</em>, where ATP is directly generated by reactions that are part of a metabolic intermediate containing an energy-rich phosphoanhydride bond that transfers its phosphate to ADT and forming ATP.</p>
<p>For <em>respiration</em> and <em>photosynthesis</em>, ATP is generated in a two-stage process in which the cell membrane plays an essential role.  Just as a membrane is necessary to separate the contents of a cell, so is a membrane necessary for energy generation and storage.  The principle is akin to charge separation.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The flow of electrons through a membrane-bound electron transport chain crates a potential between the interior and exterior of the cell.</p></li>
<li><p>Protons move across the potential due to the electromotive force and gradient in pH (proton concentration).  This movement of protons is called the proton-motive force within biology.</p></li>
<li><p>The energy supplied by the proton-motive force is then used to make ATP, via a membrane-bound enzyme called ATP synthase that couples the synthesis of ATP to the import of protons.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This process is termed <em>electron transport phosphorylation</em> or <em>oxidative phosphorylation</em>.  Hence the cell membrane plays a central role not only in the cell’s structural integrity, but also in its ability to generate energy.</p>

<p>All catabolic mechanisms lead to the generation of ATP.  <em>But which forms of catabolism generate the most ATP and are the most advantageous for the organism?</em>  A quantity used by chemists to evaluate the energy yield of a reaction is the change in <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_free_energy">Gibbs free energy</a> (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta G\)</span>) expressed in kilojoules (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm kJ\)</span>).</p>
<p>A large negative <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta G\)</span> indicates a high yield of energy, while a positive <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta G\)</span> signifies that energy is consumed.  Hence, all catabolic pathways must have a negative <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta G\)</span>, where the more negative the better.  <strong>The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta G\)</span> depends on the relative electrical potential of the electron donors and acceptors.</strong></p>
<p>Aerobic respiration (ATP yield <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(=38\)</span>) using glucose (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm C_6H_{12}O_6}\)</span>) as an electron donor and oxygen as an electron acceptor is one of the most effective in producing ATP:</p>
<div class="amsmath math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-a67477d3-b6db-4819-be23-cdb8b5b7fb60">
<span class="eqno">(6.1)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-a67477d3-b6db-4819-be23-cdb8b5b7fb60" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\begin{align}

\end{align}\]</div>
<p>Aerobic respiration produces a large negative <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta G\)</span> because the oxidation of glucose occurs at a very negative redox potential, while the reduction of oxygen occurs at a very positive redox potential.  Organisms that carry out aerobic respiration can grow fast, which includes highly evolved forms such as animals.</p>
<p>Photosynthesis is effective through the light-driven electron flow via chlorophyll and appreciated when one realizes that <a class="reference external" href="https://openstax.org/books/biology-2e/pages/6-1-energy-and-metabolism">oxygenic photosynthesis</a> is the reverse of aerobic respiration.  Since the reverse of an energy-yielding process is an energy-requiring one, the use of light via chlorophyll must be very effective.  Like animals, plants are also highly evolved and successful.</p>
<p>Other forms of respiration (e.g., methanogenesis or sulfate reduction) yield less energy:</p>
<div class="amsmath math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-2e3682d1-fcb4-47b2-b5ed-d5ffad47c318">

\end{align}\]</div>
<p>Although methanogens and sulfate reducers use electron donors with a large negative redox potential (e.g., hydrogen or organic substances), the electron acceptors (carbon dioxide and sulfate) have redox potentials that are also in the negative range.  Thus, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta G\)</span>’s have small negative values and the ATP yields are low.</p>
<p>Fermenters are also limited by small redox potential differences between the electron donor and acceptor.  <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid_fermentation">Lactic acid fermentation</a> (ATP yield <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(=2\)</span>) has a low ATP yield and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta G = -196\ {\rm kJ}\)</span>.

<h3><span class="section-number">6.1.4. </span>Early Metabolic Mechanisms<a class="headerlink" href="#early-metabolic-mechanisms" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Metabolism today is complex and diverse.  One of our tenets is that life, and metabolism, began simpler and more uniform.  The continuity of evolution means that all contemporary metabolism evolved from these modes beginnings.  Our other tenet is the early life had to make do with the nutrients that were available.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://saturnaxis.github.io/Astrobio/Chapter_05/Tree_of_Life.html#the-oparin-haldane-hypothesis">Oparin</a> originally hypothesized that the first metabolisms were not photosynthetic, where organisms obtained organic carbon from their surroundings rather than synthesizing it photosynthetically from carbon dioxide (i.e., heterotrophic).  Photosynthetic organisms are much more complex than heterotrophic organisms because they need pathways to carryout out photosynthesis and corban dioxide fixation.  This is in addition to the anabolic pathways for synthesis of amino acids and other cell materials.  In contrast, heterotrophic metabolism requires relatively few enzymes to produce cell material from organic precursors.</p>
<p>A simple type of catabolism is the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stickland_fermentation">Stickland reaction</a> that occurs in certain bacteria and involves the fermentation of amino acid pairs.  In this reaction, only two amino acids are needed and very few enzymes are required for catabolism and generation of ATP.  It is interesting to note that alanine and glycine in examples of the Stickland reaction are very stable and commonly found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites.  Therefore, these substrates may have been available for metabolism early on.</p>
<p>The hypothesis that heterotrophic metabolism arose first ignores the importance of primary production (i.e., the production of organic material either by chemosynthesis or photosynthesis).  Heterotrophic organisms <em>require</em> preformed organic material.  Although organic substrates may have been abundant on early Earth, within a short time they would have been depleted by any heterotrophic organisms.  Some process in which organic material is produced biologically on Earth is of fundamental importance in early metabolism.  The most important question concerning early metabolism becomes: <em>What were the most likely metabolism(s) of the initial primary producers?</em></p>

<p>Methanogens and acetogens partly share analogous metabolic pathways, although not phylogenetically related.  Methanogens and acetogens are both anaerobes that specialize in metabolism using one-carbon intermediates.  Hydrogen is a common electron donor and carbon dioxide a common electron acceptor.  Methane and acetic acid are the respective catabolic products.  Both organisms fix carbon dioxide by the acetyl coenzyme A (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{\rm CoA}\)</span>) pathway.  Today methanogens and acetogens play essential roles in anaerobic ecosystems and live in a variety of habitats ranging from hydrothermal vents, pond sediments, and animal digestive tracts.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>A coenzyme is any non-protein molecule required for the functioning of an enzyme.  Coenzyme A is a specific sulfur-containing organic coenzyme.</p>
</div>
<p>Today, methanogens in sediments team up with a variety of fermenters to convert cellulose-type materials to methane and carbon dioxide.  Before photosynthesis, the Earth and its biosphere were quite different.  Organic materials were limited to those formed by abiotic processes and by a feeble primary production.  Autotrophy (or primary producers) may have been preferred over heterotrophy, necessitating a means of carbon dioxide fixation.  On the early Earth, electron donors and acceptors for catabolism may have been rare or limited to a few elements or compounds.  In this most ancient of biological worlds, methanogens or acetogen may have been the <em>only</em> metabolic types.</p>
<p>Analogs of the early Earth may exist today:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Microbial communities in the Earth’s subsurface are apparently dominated by methanogens that obtain hydrogen from reduced minerals in rock.</p></li>
<li><p>Deep basalt aquifers, hot springs, and submarine hydrothermal vents are examples of sites where microbial ecosystems may be supported by hydrogen of geological origin.</p></li>

<p>Further support for the ancient nature of the acetyl <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm CoA\)</span> pathway comes from evidence that the crucial reaction could have occurred prebiotically.  <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCnter_W%C3%A4chtersh%C3%A4user">Günther Wächtershäuser</a> proposed the theory that metabolism evolved from prebiotic chemistry, where he has shown in the laboratory that under primordial conditions a methyl group can react with carbon monoxide to yield an acetyl group (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.276.5310.245">Huber and Wächtershäuser (1997)</a>).</p>
<p>Particularly interesting was the observation that the reaction required nickel sulfide and iron sulfide as catalysts.  The enzyme that catalyzes the reaction in present-day organisms also contains a nick-iron-sulfur center.

<p>Another significant feature of the methanogenic and acetogenic metabolism is the use of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm H_2\)</span> as the catabolic electron donor.  The electron transport chain of many organism is a complex multi-component assembly that moves proteins from inside to the outside of cells as electrons flow from one electron carrier to another.  These complex electron chains are characteristic of organotrophs and phototrophs, as well as aerobic lithotrophs that oxidize inorganic compounds other than hydrogen.</p>
<p>The use of hydrogen offers the possibility of a simpler mechanism of a simpler mechanism in which a proton-motive force is generated without the transport of protons.  The products of hydrogen oxidation are simply protons and electrons.  If the oxidation of hydrogen occurs on the outside of the cell membrane, then protons can accumulate there.  A simple electron carrier that spans the membrane can then deliver electrons to the inside.  The electrons can then be used on the inside in a proton-consuming reaction to reduce carbon dioxide to methane or acetic acid.  The result is a proton-motive force.</p>
<p>This simple mechanism requiring only an extracellular hydrogen-oxidizing enzyme (hydrogenase) and a membrane-bound electron carrier (e.g., iron-sulfur protein) has not yet actually been demonstrated in the methanogens or acetogens.  But neither is it excluded as a primordial mechanism or as one that operates today.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.1.6. </span>Evolution of Photosynthesis<a class="headerlink" href="#evolution-of-photosynthesis" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The evolution of photosynthesis greatly enhanced the capability of the planet to carry out primary production.  organisms have evolved to make efficient use of light energy, which has always been available and abundant on the surface fo the planet.  Although the evolution of photosynthesis most likely followed the evolution of simpler primary production mechanisms, when it evolved it had a major impact on all life.</p>
<p>Photosynthesis has been found in Bacteria and Eukarya.  A remarkable variety of photosynthetic bacterial groups exists.  Within the Bacteria, five of the major phyla contain photosynthetic members: Protobacteria, Fimicutes, Chorobi, Choroflexi, and Cyanobacteria.  <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._B._van_Niel">C.B. van Niel</a> proposed (in 1941) the following general reaction for photosynthesis:</p>

<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm H_2A}\)</span> can stand for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm H_2S}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm H_2}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm H_2O}\)</span>, an organic compound, or even ferrous iron (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm Fe^{2+}\)</span>). <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm (CH_2O)}\)</span> represents an organic product of the photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Many of the photosynthetic bacteria are restricted to anoxic habitats and ues <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm H_2S}\)</span> as a source of electrons.  Thus the reaction for these bacteria is:</p>

<p>These phototrophs can often further oxidize the elemental sulfur to produce sulfate anaerobically during photosynthesis:</p>

<p>Cyanobacteria are best known as the first organisms to use water to carry out <em>oxygenic</em> photosynthesis, in which oxygen is produced:</p>

{\rm CO_2} + {\rm H_2O} + \text{light} \rightarrow {\rm (CH_2O)} + {\rm O_2}.
\end{align}\]</div>
<p>Note that the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm O_2}\)</span> comes from the water and not the carbon dioxide.  For this reason, oxygenic photosynthesis is called the “water splitting” reaction.  Apart from cyanobacteria, all photosynthetic bacteria carry out photosynthesis anaerobically and oxygen is <em>not</em> produced.  This anaerobic process is referred to as <em>anoxygenic</em> photosynthesis.</p>
<p><em>When did photosynthesis evolve?</em>  The availability  of suitable substrates is not a constraint because they were all available, as was light.  The main constraint has to do with complexity.  to generate a proton-motive force photosynthetically requires the addition of chlorophyll, aw well as a relatively complex electron transport chain  involving the transport of protons across the membrane.  This mechanism is more likely to have followed the relatively simple <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm H_2}\)</span> chemosynthetic mechanisms.</p>
<p>The time of emergence of different photosynthetic types is unresolved in the geologic record, but available evidence suggests that anoxic phototrophs predated the cyanobacteria.  At that time the entire planet was anoxic, since the cyanobacteria had yet to begin to oxygenate the atmosphere and oceans.  The evolutionary emergence of the cyanobacteria was the result of a remarkable biochemical innovation, where the development of a light-driven electron transport system that could fix <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm CO_2\)</span> with electrons extracted from water, liberating its oxygen.  This photosystem, composed of two photosynthetic reaction centers, was likely built upon the machinery of earlier simpler microorganisms that were restricted to anoxic habitats and that used reduced sulfur as a source of electrons.</p>
<p>The time of cyanobacterial emergence has been dated to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.1-2.5\ {\rm Ga}\)</span> on the basis of protein sequences, which is consistent with the geochemical estimate for the era of oxygenation of Earth’s atmosphere and oceans (i.e., from the banded iron formations).  The evolution of photosynthesis liberated microbial life from dependence on geochemically produced, reduced substrates (e.g., <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm H_2S\)</span>), resulting in an explosive increase in biomass on Earth.  By using water as a reductant, life was free to fully colonized the planet, now requiring only water, light, carbon dioxide, and organic substrates for growth and division.</p>
<p>The innovation of oxygenic photosynthesis began a remarkable evolutionary progression, culminating in the development of complex animal and planet species.  The development of an oxygen-rich atmosphere prepared the biosphere for the emergence of higher life forms.  Only by burning reduced carbon with oxygen (via an electron transport chain) could sufficient energy be released to fuel large multicellular organisms.  The resultant atmospheric oxygen produced an ozone layer in the statosphere that is strongly absorbent of UV radiation.  When the ozone layer became significant, this opened up land to colonization by planets and animals (due to lower UV radiation) who no longer needed water for protection.</p>

<p>The structural coherence of the community is provided by extracellular polymers produced by the mat microorganism and by the filamentous forms of some dominant populations.  The top layer (i.e., canopy), primarily consists of oxygen-producing bacteria, cyanobacteria.  Together with the anoxygenic phototrophs, the cyanobacteria sustain a remarkably diverse undergrowth of other microorganisms.  Virtually all major physiological types of microbes are resident in contemporary microbial mats, and they sustain all central biogeochemical cycles, where each element is alternately oxidized and reduced by the metabolism of different microorganisms.</p>
<p>Under the microscope, the activities of these highly organized populations shape the chemical structure of the mat, forming sharp gradients of oxygen, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm pH\)</span>, sulfide, and other chemical species (via a metabolic process).  High productivity by photo- or chemosynthesis allows each mat to sustain significant biomass on little more than water, sunlight, and available inorganic nutrients.</p>
<p>The most impressive mat communities occur in extreme environments (compared to conditions for multicellular life), since significant biomass accumulation can only occur in the absence of grazing.  For example, today’s mats of thermophilic cyanobacteria are common in hot springs worldwide.  Mats also thrive in hypersaline lagoons, as well as in intermittently dry intertidal regions. Mats also build calcified stromatolites in warm seas, from desert soil crust, and grow within the frozen rocks of Antarctica as endolithic mats.  They even thrive embedded in the ice cover of Antarctic dry valley lakes.</p>
<p>The fossil record suggests that mats were once widely distributed on early Earth.  The decline of extensive microbial mat systems in the rock record is generally attributed tot he emergence of multicellular grazers and water planets that ultimate forced them to a much more limited habitat range.  The most conspicuous and often enigmatic vestiges of the early microbial biosphere and microbial mats are stromatolites.  It is generally accepted (but not always proven) that the sediment trapping or mineral precipitation processes that formed stromatolites were mediated by ancient microbial communities.  The existence of fossil stromatolites beginning in the early and middle Archean is consistent with isotopic evidence fro autotrophic carbon fixation in the early Archean, and very strongly suggests that photoautotrophy existed.</p>
<p>Today there is increasing recognition that microorganisms are extremely promiscuous.  Horizontal gene transfer is not restricted to closely related organisms.  Exchange within and between domains is now well documented and increasingly recognized to be a major force in shaping metabolic innovation.  We speculate that the high density and close associations among microorganisms in microbial mat provided a superb environment for genetic exchange between populations.  If this is true, some of the most significant events in the history of our planet may have occurred in microbial mats.  For example, the cyanobacteria may have emerged within this context as a result of melding the photosystems of anoxic phototrophs.</p>
